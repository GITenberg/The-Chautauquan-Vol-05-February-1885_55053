<p>It has occurred to me that some readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
may have been disappointed in these articles because in
their judgment they have been thus far not sufficiently “practical.”
Many people, far too many, desire chiefly to find some
short, straight road to knowledge. They like to have some
man who is called an “authority” upon a certain subject
cut his knowledge up into small parcels or “chunks” of
convenient size, and arrange them with labels, alphabetically,
in an article or a book, so that they maybe referred to at need,
and followed like a recipe for making a pudding, and with as
little thought. But there are no such recipes for acquiring
real knowledge. In this way an acquaintance with facts may
be made which, used blindly, may prove of some immediate
service, and may not. Nothing, however, learned in this perfunctory
way is worthy of the name of knowledge. For it is a
barren process; it really teaches nothing; it profits nothing;
it does nothing for the education of the person by whom it is
adopted. Real knowledge comes only by a thoughtful learning
of the relations of facts. True as to all subjects, this is
eminently true as to language; because, language is eminently
a subject of relations. There is hardly a word that
we use which has not relations to other words, and other forms
of speech; relations historical, spiritual, almost moral; to set
forth which in detail would furnish occasion for a little essay.
The mere learning to speak and to write a language is only a
matter of memory and practice; nothing more. It is child’s
work, and it is continually done, and is best done, by children.
A man may speak and write English, French, German or Latin
with unexceptionable correctness and fluency, and yet know
no more about that language than a well instructed parrot
would which had been taught to use all the words which
he uses. His study would not be a study of language; and in
that which he had painfully learned he might be easily and
unconsciously surpassed by a child who had never studied at
all. Now what I hope to do here is to help my readers to some
knowledge of the English language, in so far as my own imperfect
acquaintance with my mother tongue and its literature
will enable me to do so.</p>

<p>We have seen what English is, of what stuff it is made, how
it came by its present compositeness of substance; how it became
strong, and full, and flexible, and fervent; let us now
look a little into its structure, <i>i. e.</i>, the way in which it is put
together, in doing which we shall see by comparison how it
differs from other languages. This matter of structure, the
formation of the sentence, is the distinctive trait of a language.
Mere words are not the essential difference between languages.
Many words are common (with slight phonetic variation) to all
the languages of the Aryan or Indo-European stock, as we
have already seen. Multitudes of words have been adopted
into all the modern tongues from other languages ancient and
modern, dead and living, as most of the readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
know. The bulk of English dictionaries like Webster’s
and Worcester’s is composed of words which are of
Latin, Greek, French or Italian origin, and which indeed are
essentially the same words in all these languages; their unlikeness
being merely a phonetic variation, mostly caused by
difference in pronunciation, or change in termination. For
example, <i>flower</i> is in Latin <i>flos</i> (genitive <i>floris</i>), in Italian
<i>fiore</i>, in French <i>fleur</i>, in Spanish <i>flor</i>; each language having
somewhat changed the sound of the word, according to
rules or habits which are loosely called laws; but the word is
in all essentially the same. A sentence—many sentences—might
be written in English, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish
and German, in which all the words of subject-matter (all but
verbs like <i>have</i> and <i>be</i>, and prepositions and conjunctions)
should be essentially the same, and so like that an intelligent
person with some faculty for language, and who understood
any one of these languages, could apprehend the meaning of
any one of the supposed sentences with little difficulty. And
yet the sentences would be respectively English, Latin,
French, and so forth. Why and how? It is to the reason of
this, that is the why and the how of it, that we shall now give
a little time and attention.</p>

<p>The most important and significant distinction between languages
is in their grammar; that is, in the structure of the
sentence. In the languages mentioned above the greatest unlikeness
in this respect is manifested in English, Latin and
German, or to name them in their order of grammatical importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Latin, German and English. The term “grammar”
has two senses; one large and vague, and called by some
“philosophical” or “scientific” (phrases commonly used with
a deplorable union of pretension and looseness), which includes
all that relates to the history, the substance and the
structure of a language; the other much narrower and simpler;
the sense implied when the phrases “good grammar”
and “bad grammar” are used. To this sense I shall here
confine myself, and shall here repeat a definition of grammar
which I have given before.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Grammar concerns the forms of words and their dependent
relations in the sentence.</p>

<p>To illustrate this: It is “bad grammar,” ludicrously, monstrously
bad grammar, to say in Latin, <i>Nos habeo bonus mater</i>,
and yet these Latin words, literally and simply translated in
their order, mean, We have a good mother, which in English
is perfectly “good grammar.” In the Latin (to call it Latin)
every word is wrong; in English every word is right. The
reason of this is that in Latin words change their forms according
to their relations, not according to their essential
meaning. <i>Habeo</i> means have; but it can not be used to express
a plural having; that requires for <i>we</i> (<i>nos</i>) the form
<i>habemus</i>. <i>Bonus</i> means good; but it can not be used to express
the goodness of a feminine object, for which the form
<i>bona</i> is required. Yet further: Even <i>bona</i> can not be used to
qualify a noun which is the object of a verb, or, as we say, in
the objective (or accusative) case, for which the form <i>bonam</i>
is required. <i>Mater</i> means mother, but as the object of the verb
<i>have</i>, <i>mater</i> must change its form to <i>matrem</i>. By these required
changes of form the Latin sentence becomes, <i>Nos habemus
bonam matrem</i>, which is “good grammar,” although
poor Latin, but which, after all the changes, means simply,
We have a good mother; nothing more nor less. Yet further:
The sentence, as written above, although grammatical, is poor
Latin because it is at variance with the habit, or as it is sometimes
called the spirit, or even the genius, of the Latin language.
In Latin the word <i>habemus</i> (although like <i>habeo</i> it
means simply, have) is so positively and distinctively limited
in use to the first person plural that the pronoun <i>nos</i>—we—is
quite superfluous, and is never used unless with an emphatic
purpose; <i>habemus</i>, without the <i>nos</i>, means, we have. Moreover
it was the Latin habit of speech to place the object generally
before the verb; and good Latin for, We have a good
mother would be, <i>bonam matrem habemus</i>—<i>i. e.</i>, A good
mother we have, or rather (literally) Good mother we have
for the Latin strangely has no articles, or none which correspond
to our <i>an</i> (<i>or a</i>) and <i>the</i>, and which may be translated by
them.</p>

<p>This illustration, brief and simple although it be, is sufficient,
I think, to make the great and essential distinction between
English and Latin, and measurably between English
and all other modern civilized tongues, clear to the readers of
these articles. The essential difference is not one of words
but of the construction of the sentence. In Latin and other
languages that construction depends not upon the thought and
the meaning of the words, but upon the forms of the words—their
inflections. Now the distinctive trait of English is that it
is a language without inflections—not absolutely so, but so to
all intents and purposes; and, being without inflections, it is
therefore without grammar, which, as we have seen, concerns
the forms of words and their dependent relations in the sentence.
<i>Nos habeo bonus mater</i> is bad grammar because the
forms of the words are incorrect according to the usage of the
Latin language. <i>Bonus</i> means good; but for the expression
of the quality good in its barest, simplest idea <i>bonus</i> takes on
five forms in Latin; <i>bonus</i> for masculine goodness in the singular,
<i>bona</i> for feminine singular, <i>bonum</i> for neuter singular;
<i>boni</i> masculine plural; <i>bonæ</i> feminine plural, <i>bona</i> neuter
plural. To be brief; for use in various relations, this word
<i>bonus</i> takes on no less than thirteen forms, of which more need
not here be given. <i>Mater</i>—mother—takes on eight of these
forms or inflections, which are called cases. But in English
<i>good</i> has but one form. Singular, plural, masculine, feminine,
neuter, nominative, possessive, dative, objective, vocative—in
whichever of these senses the word which it qualifies is
used it has but one form—<i>good</i>. Thus it is with all English adjectives,
and with articles (<i>an</i> and <i>the</i>) which are a kind of
adjective. In all other languages adjectives and articles have
various forms adapted to the various numbers, genders, and
cases of nouns. In English nouns have two cases (strictly but
one, the nominative not being a true case), the second of which
is the possessive: <i>e. g.</i>, mother’s; and they have a singular and
a plural form, <i>e. g.</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>mothers</i>.</p>

<p>In other languages the verb is inflected into a multitude of
forms, expressive of voice (active and passive), person, number
and time of action. In English the variations of form in the
verb are very few. There is no passive voice. The English
has but one passive verb; the obsolete <i>hight</i>, which means, is
called. As to time, there are only the forms of present and
perfect, e. g., <i>love</i> and <i>loved</i>; as to person and number, inflections
only in the present tense, e. g., <i>love</i>, <i>lovest</i>, <i>loves</i>; and
of these one, <i>lovest</i>, is obsolete, or very obsolescent. To these
inflected forms there is to be added only the present or indefinite
participle <i>loving</i>. Beyond this there are in English, by
way of inflection, only the cases of the pronouns, e. g., <i>he</i>, <i>his</i>,
<i>him</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>whose</i>, <i>whom</i>, <i>etc.</i> And it is here to be remarked
that almost all the questions of “good grammar” and “bad
grammar” that arise in English relate to the use of pronouns.
(For surely we may leave out of consideration here the difficulties
of those who say <i>I see</i> or <i>I seen him</i>, for <i>I saw him</i>, or <i>I
have went</i> for <i>I have gone</i>, and the like.) Here, therefore, we
have set forth, although very succinctly, the distinctive
grammatical position of the English language.</p>

<p>That position is briefly this: In English words have (with the
few exceptions mentioned above) but one form; and as grammar
is concerned only with the formal relations of words in
the sentence, English has no grammar. Among languages it
is the grammarless tongue.</p>

<p>Let us further illustrate this point by a brief consideration
of a subject which is very perplexing to the learners of a
foreign language, and which is not less so to the historical students
of language in general; a subject which, I believe, has
never been explained by the latter with any semblance of satisfaction—gender.
All other languages are infested with gender;
in English there is no such distinction in words as that
of gender. English, it should be needless to say, has words to
express difference of sex; that no language can fail to do, for
failing in that, it would not communicate the facts and thoughts
of every-day life. But grammatical gender has no relation to sex,
no relation to the essential characteristics of things. Gender,
grammatical gender, is an attribute of <i>words</i>. He creatures
are male, she creatures female, and the words which are their
names are generally (but not universally) masculine and feminine
in all languages. Things neither male nor female are
neuter, which means merely, neither. But this is not gender.
Gender, as I have said before, is an attribute of words; of
words only. For example, the Latin word <i>penna</i>—a pen, or
quill, is feminine; in French the word <i>table</i>—table, is also
feminine. It is needless to say that there is no question as to
the sex of a pen, or of a table; nor is there any quality in either
of those objects which has a sexual trait or characteristic. In
each case it is the word which is of the feminine gender; and
in all, or almost all, languages but English all or almost all
words are afflicted with this mysterious pest of gender. How
annoying and perplexing it is, and how it complicates the use
of language, and makes the acquisition of foreign languages
difficult, no student needs be told. For it creates an ever present
and far-reaching perplexity. It dominates the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the sentence and binds it up in bonds of iron. For every adjective,
and in French and other languages having articles,
every article which is applied to a noun must be of the gender
of that noun. You can not say in Latin <i>bonus penna</i>, a good
pen, without “bad grammar,” you must say <i>bona penna</i>. You
can not say in French <i>un mauvais table</i>, a bad table, but must
say <i>une mauvaise table</i>; nor <i>le table</i>, but <i>la table</i>—although
both mean the table, nothing more nor less. The absurdity
of this is made very apparent when a feminine word is applied
to a male object. Thus <i>majesté</i>—majesty, is feminine; but
when a king is called your majesty, the words <i>sa majesté</i> (her
majesty) are used because the <i>word majesty</i> is feminine; and
instead of saying he (<i>il</i>) did thus or so, we must say she (<i>elle</i>)
did it, although the she was a man; the reason being that the
word <i>majesté</i> is feminine.<a href="#english1" id="anch_english1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> All this has been swept clean away
in English, in which language there is no distinction of gender
but only that of sex: male creatures, or those so personified,
are masculine, female, feminine; those which have no sex are
neuter; and there an end. English is eminently a language
of common sense; and one marked evidence of this trait is its
freeing itself entirely from the nuisance of grammatical gender
along with other grammatical trammels.<a href="#english2" id="anch_english2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It has <i>freed</i> itself from those trammels; for at one time it
was hampered by them sorely. Anglo-Saxon, or Old English,
was an inflected speech, and was tied up in the bonds of gender
and other grievous grammatical tetherings. This was long
ago; but it was after Britain had become England, or Engle-land,
the land of the English people and of English speech.
When our English forefathers were little better than semi-savages,
bloody, barbarous, heathen, worshiping Thor and Woden,
and in a state of benighted ignorance of which it would be
difficult for those of my readers who have not tried to pierce
the darkness of that historical past to form even an approximate
notion—at this time, and in this social and intellectual
condition of the speakers of the English language, it was copiously
provided with grammar. Even Greek had not much
the better of it in this respect. It had not only forms for person
and number, but gender forms, and cases galore.<a href="#english3" id="anch_english3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Take,
for example, a word which was English a thousand years ago,
just as it is to-day, <i>man</i>. This simple word has undergone no
change in all the thousand years, unless by losing a little
breadth of sound; it having probably been pronounced <i>mahn</i>,
of which sound the rustic <i>mon</i> of provincial England is a relic
and representative. But <i>man</i> could not be used pure and simple,
under all circumstances and in all cases, in the English
of that day any more than, as we have seen, <i>mater</i> and <i>bonus</i>
could be so used in Latin. There was the nominative singular—<i>man</i>,
simply; the genitive <i>mannes</i>—of a man; the dative
<i>men</i>, to or for a man; accusative <i>mannan</i>—a man objectively;
nominative plural <i>men</i>; genitive <i>manna</i>—of men, or
men’s; and a dative <i>mannum</i>—to or for men.</p>

<p>Of all these various forms or cases of <i>man</i>, the language
has freed itself, excepting the genitive singular, <i>mannes</i>, and
the nominative plural, <i>men</i>. These have been retained, not by
accident, or neglect, but at the dictate of common sense, because
convenience and intelligibility required their use. It
was found necessary to distinguish the plural from the singular;
and the genitive or possessive idea from the simple and
absolute; but <i>man</i> as a dative or accusative singular, and <i>men</i>
as the same in the plural, were found quite as useful and convenient
as the old inflected forms; and therefore (or therefore
finally and in a great measure) the latter were discarded. The
genitive or possessive has been retained; but it has slightly
changed its form; by contraction only, however; <i>mannes</i> has
become <i>man’s</i>. The old sign of the possessive was <i>es</i>; and it
is this, and not the pronoun <i>his</i> (as once was supposed) that is
represented in our possessive case, in which the apostrophe
merely marks the elision of the old <i>e</i>. There is really no good
reason for the use of the apostrophe, none which would not apply
equally to many other cases in which no elision is marked. In
the Elizabethan era it was not used, and with no consequent
confusion. Mans folly, the boys hat, Johns coat, are as clear
in meaning as they would be with the apostrophe; and the
possible confusion of the possessive with the plural, as in that
fancy of the girls, and that fancy of the girl’s is so remote and
so very unlikely as to be worthy of little consideration.</p>

<p>As to English in its earliest form (Anglo-Saxon) suffice it
here to say in this regard that it was so largely an inflected
language, that is, it varied the forms of its words so numerously
to express time of action, mode of action, person, number,
case, and gender, that it is in this respect almost as unlike
modern English as Greek is, and is little less difficult of acquirement
to the English speaking student of to-day than Latin.
Its very articles had gender forms as well as case forms; and,
moreover, like the Mæso-Gothic and like the Greek it had
preserved the old dual number (for the expression of a plural
of two) although only in the personal pronoun. A comparative
examination of the pronoun of the first person and of the
present tense of the verb <i>to have</i> in their ancient and modern
forms will show the mode and the reason of the changes by
which English has assumed its present character.</p>

<p>The dual form has been swept away entirely as needless, and
worse, cumbrous and perplexing; but it will be seen that we have
retained every one of the other forms. <i>Ic</i> has become I; <i>mine</i>
is still the possessive of I; <i>me</i> is still not only the objective form
of the first person, but the dative, “make me a hat,” or “buy
me a horse,” being merely “make a hat to or for me,” or “buy
to or for me a horse.” <i>We</i> and <i>us</i> will be recognized at sight,
and <i>ure</i> has only changed its pronunciation from <i>oor</i> to <i>our</i>.
These forms have been retained in our modern English partly
because a pronoun is the most ancient of indestructible parts
of speech,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> but chiefly because of their usefulness, their convenience.
A brief consideration of them by the intelligent
reader will make this so plain that more need not be said on
the subject.</p>

<p>Now let us see the unlike fate of the verb <i>to have</i>. This will
be more readily apparent if we look at it in Latin, in French,
and in English (it is actually the same word in all these languages,
with slight phonetic variation); and we shall thus also
have another demonstration of the manner in which English
differs from other languages.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that the Latin and the French have
each a special plural form, and also three forms for the three
persons of that number. English has swept away this plural
form entirely, and uses for the plural in all its persons the simple
<i>have</i> of the first person singular. The form of the second
person singular has also virtually disappeared; the simple <i>have</i>
appearing in its substitute, <i>you have</i>. Whether the form of the
third person singular will ever follow the other is doubtful; but
it is certain that our language has lost nothing in clearness,
and has gained much in simplicity by the doing away with all
the formal superfluity by which the old numbers and persons
were distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>This simplification of the forms of words is not absolutely
confined to the English language. It appears to be a tendency
of language; a modern tendency, using modern in its widest
sense. For this movement toward simplification appears in
the Latin, in the Romance tongues formed from it, and in the
Gothic languages. In none, however, does this simplification,
this destruction of superfluous forms, approach, even remotely,
that which has taken place in English. So different, indeed,
are the results, that the process seems, if not of another kind,
at least as having another motive. For example, all the other
languages retain the absurdity of gender. In this respect
German is no better than French. And let me here remark
that the common notion that English and German are most alike
of all modern languages, and most nearly akin, is altogether
wrong. On the contrary, English and German are very unlike;
the most unlike of all the Gothic (or Teutonic) languages.
English and French have much greater likeness, both in substance
and in structure. There are more words now common
to the English language and to the French than to English and
German; and the syntax of the French language is very much
more like that of the English, than German syntax is. A French
sentence literally translated in the French order of the words is,
in most cases, so like an English sentence that it requires little
change to be correct English, while a similar translation of a
German sentence produces an effect both harsh and ludicrous.</p>

<p>The simple form of the English language is the result of two
causes. Of these the first in order of time was the conflict and
subsequent mingling of the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) and
the Norman-French. When two languages are thus brought
together and are both spoken by two peoples, all that is superfluous
in the words of each soon begins to disappear. Each people
grasps only the essential in the foreign words which it is obliged
to use; each soon adopts the curtailed form of its speech
used by the neighbors of another race and speech with whom it
is obliged to live in daily communication; and ere long a composite
speech of simpler forms takes the place of two tongues—each
of which was more complex in structure, but less rich and
varied in substance. By this process, out of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, came modern English. But not only thus.
Other languages have mingled, but never before with such a result.
Never was there in any other amalgamation, such an esurience
of superfluous form; a devouring which has to all intents
and purposes made English a language of one-formed words, and
therefore a language practically without formal grammar. In
this characteristic is its strength; from this comes its flexibility,
its adaptation to all the needs of man, the highest and the lowest.
Hence it is eminently the language of common sense as
well as of the highest flights of poetry. The English mind
saw that it was not necessary to have two words to express possession
in the singular and in the plural; that <i>good</i> as clearly
expressed the goodness of a woman as of a man, and that of a
dozen men as well as that of one; that pens and tables needed
no distinction of gender in their names; in fact that nothing
was gained, and that much was lost by these grammatical excrescences;
and therefore they were done away with very thoroughly,
almost entirely. The process was pretty well completed
some three hundred years or more ago; since when no
noteworthy changes in this respect have taken place. But it is
still going on, although so slowly as to be perceptible only on
close examination. All the little specks of grammar that English
has are mostly to be found in the pronouns, as I have before
remarked. In the use of one of these a change is very
gradually taking place. <i>Whom</i> has begun to disappear, began,
indeed, a long time ago; but of late is fading somewhat
more perceptibly. For example: all speakers of good English
say, The man whom I saw, not The man who I saw; <i>whom</i>
being the objective form of <i>who</i>.</p>

<p>But now-a-days not one person in a hundred of the best bred
and best educated speakers of English asks, Whom did you
see? but, <i>Who</i> did you see? Indeed, the latter form of the
question may be regarded almost as accepted English. Yet in
the latter phrase, as in the former, the pronoun is the object of
the verb <i>see</i>, and should strictly have the objective form. But,
Whom did you see? would now sound very formal and precise,
almost priggish, like <i>gotten</i> instead of <i>got</i>. When, however,
the pronoun is brought in direct contact with the verb, as in
the phrase, The man whom I saw, we shrink from insult to the
little semblance of grammar that our language possesses, and
give the word its objective form. The time will probably come,
although it may be remote, when <i>whom</i> will have altogether
disappeared. As to <i>gotten</i>, its use is now so confined to the
over-precise in this country as to make it almost an Americanism.
Its disappearance from our language in England is also
one of the evidences of the process of simplification which is
still slowly going on. Another, which has taken place within
the memory of the elder living generation, is the disappearance
of the subjunctive mood, which is now obsolete, or so very obsolescent
as to be met with very rarely. But thirty-five or forty
years since correct writers used this mood, and wrote, for example,
<i>if he go</i> instead of <i>if he goes</i>. Of the effect of this grammarless
condition of the English language we may see something
in a subsequent article.</p>

<p>The Deity is intended to be the everlasting field of the human
intellect, as well as the everlasting object of the human
heart, the everlasting portion of all holy and happy minds,
who are destined to spend a blissful but ever active eternity in
the contemplation of his glory.… He will forever remain
“the unknown God.” We shall ever be conscious that we
know little compared with what remains to be known of him;
that our most rapturous and lofty songs fall infinitely short of
his excellence. If we stretch our powers to the uttermost, we
shall never exhaust his praise, never render him adequate
honor, never discharge the full amount of claim which he
possesses upon our veneration, obedience, and gratitude.
When we have loved him with the greatest favor, our love will
still be cold compared with his title to our devoted attachment.
This will render him the continual source of fresh delight to
all eternity. His perfection will be an abyss never to be fathomed;
there will be depths in his excellence which we shall
never be able to penetrate. We shall delight in losing ourselves
in his infinity. An unbounded prospect will be extended
before us; looking forward through the vista of interminable
ages we shall find a blissful occupation for our faculties,
which can never end; while those faculties will retain
their vigor unimpaired, flourish in the bloom of perpetual
youth, … and the full consciousness remain that the Being
whom we contemplate can never be found out to perfection
… that he may always add to the impression of what we
know, by throwing a veil of indefinite obscurity over his character.
The shades in which he will forever conceal himself
will have the same tendency to excite our adoring wonder as
the effulgence of his glory; the depths in which he will retire
from our view, the recesses of his wisdom and power as the
open paths of his manifestation. Were we capable of comprehending
the Deity, devotion would not be the sublimest employment
to which we can attain. In the contemplation of
such a Being we are in no danger of going beyond our subject;
we are conversing with an infinite object, … in the
depths of whose essence and purposes we are forever lost.
This will probably give all the emotions of freshness and astonishment
to the raptures of beatific vision, and add a delightful
zest to the devotions of eternity. This will enable the
Divine Being to pour in continually fresh accessions of light;
to unfold new views of his character, disclose new parts of his
perfection, open new mansions of himself, in which the mind
will have ample room to expatiate. Thus shall we learn, to
eternity, that, so far from exhausting his infinite fullness, there
still remain infinite recesses in his nature unexplored—scenes
in his counsels never brought before the view of his creatures;
that we know but “parts of his ways;” and that instead of exhausting
our theme, we are not even approaching nearer to
the comprehension of the Eternal All. It is the mysteriousness
of God, the inscrutability of his essence, the shade in
which he is invested, that will excite those peculiar emotions
which nothing but transcendent perfection and unspeakable
grandeur can inspire.—<i>Robert Hall.</i><a href="#sunday2" id="anch_sunday2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>If we allow the beauties of nature to raise our heart to God,
we turn that into a sacrifice. If cross incidents, which could
not be avoided or averted, are taken sweetly and lovingly, out
of homage to the living will of God, this, too, is a sacrifice.
If work be done in the full view of God’s assignment of our
several tasks and spheres of labor, and under the consciousness
of his presence, however secular in its character, it immediately
becomes fit for presentation on the altar. If refreshment
and amusement are so moderated as to help the spirit
instead of dissipating it, if they are to be seasoned with the
wholesome salt of self-denial (for every sacrifice must be seasoned
with salt) they, too, become a holy oblation. If we
study even perverse characters, with a loving hope and belief
that we shall find something of God and Christ in them, which
may be made the nucleus of better things, and instead of shutting
ourselves up in a narrow sphere of sympathies, seek out
and try to develop the good points of a generally uncongenial
spirit; if we treat men as Christ treated them, counting that
somewhere in every one there is a better mind, and the trace
of God’s finger in creation, we may thus possibly sanctify an
hour which would else be one of irksome constraint, and after
which we might have been oppressed with a heavy feeling that
it had been a wasted one. If a small trifle, destined to purchase
some personal luxury or comfort, be diverted to a charitable
and religious end, this is the regular and standing sacrifice
of alms, recognized by the Scripture and the Liturgy. And
finally, if we regard our time as, next to Christ, and the Holy
Spirit, the most precious gift of God; if we gather up the fragments
and interstices of it in a thrifty and religious manner,
and employ them in some exercise of devotion or some good
and useful work, this, too, becomes a tribute which God will
surely accept with complacency, if laid upon his altar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
united by faith and a devout intention with the one Sacrifice of
our dear Lord.</p>

<p>Yes; if laid upon his altar; let us never forget or drop out
of sight that proviso. It is the altar, and the altar alone,
which sanctifieth the gift. Apart from Christ and his perfect
sacrifice, an acceptable gift is an impossibility for man. For
at best our gifts have in them the sinfulness of our nature;
they are miserably flawed by defectiveness of motive, duplicity
of aim, infirmity of will. “The prayers of all saints,” what
force of interpretation must they have with God, if, as we are
sure, “the effectual, fervent prayer of a” (single) “righteous
man availeth much!” Yet when St. John saw in a vision “the
prayers of all saints” offered “upon the golden altar which
was before the throne,” it was in union with that which alone
can perfume the tainted offsprings of even the regenerate man.
“There was given unto him much increase, that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar
which is before the throne.”</p>

<p>The increase is the intercession of Jesus. Place your offering,
be it prayer or alms, deed or work, or submission—in his
hands for presentation; pray him, as your only priest, to transact
for you with God, and he will do so. And the sense of
God’s favor shall shine out upon thy offering; and the dew of
his blessing shall descend upon it, and ye shall be gladdened
with your Father’s smile.—<i>Goulburn.</i><a href="#sunday3" id="anch_sunday3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Heaven, as a place of residence and state of enjoyment,
should always be viewed in contrast with earth.</i> This is a
state of pupilage and probation, that of dignity and promotion.
Here is conflict, there victory. This is the race, that the goal.
Here we suffer, there we reign. Here we are in exile, there at
home. On earth we are strangers and pilgrims, in heaven fellow
citizens with the saints; and, released from the strife and
turmoil, the bitterness and regrets of earth, are incorporated
forever with the household of God.</p>

<p>This is triumph! How striking the contrast! How must
earth and its trials be lost sight of in such a vision! How must
this contrast strengthen the ties of confidence, and kindle the
ardor of devotion!</p>

<p>What did Moses care for the perils of the wilderness, when,
from the storm-defying steep of Pisgah, he viewed the land of
promise, imaging forth the green fields of heaven’s eternal
spring! Look at Elijah, the immortal Tishbite, exchanging the
sighs and solitude of his juniper shade, for wheels of fire and
steeds of wind that bore him home to God! Look at Paul—poor,
periled and weary, amid the journeyings and conflicts of
his mission: the hand that once stretched the strong eastern
tent, or wore the dungeon’s chain, now sweeps in boldest strain
the harps of heaven.… Look at the Christian of apostolic
and early times, exchanging the clanking of his chains and the
curses of his jailor—the dungeon’s den and martyr’s stake—for
the notes of gladness and lofty anthem pealing from lute and
harp, bedecked with eternal amaranth! The load of chain
with which he went out to meet the descending car of his triumph,
with its angel escort, was a richer dowry than the jewels
of empire! The taper that flickered in the dungeon of the
sainted hero shot a ray more glorious than ever spoke the
splendor of the full-orbed moon! What are the crowns or the
diadems of all this world’s masters or Cæsars, compared with
the prospects of such an expectant!</p>

<p>Christians! what need we care, although on earth we were
so poor and low we had nor purse nor pillow; so few and trodden
down we had no power; and hamlets, huts and grottoes
were the places where we wept and prayed; if these are to be
exchanged for a residence amid the jaspers and chrysolites, the
emeralds and sapphires of the heavenly Jerusalem!</p>

<p>What though soiled by the dust of toil or damp with the
dungeon’s dew—struggling amid tattered want along our lone
and periled path—when even here we find ourselves invested
with glory in the night of our being, and sustained by hopes
guiding and pointing us to the temple hymn and the heavenly

<h3>CHEMISTRY OF FIRE.—ANCIENT FANCIES.</h3>

<p>In all ages, and among all nations, fire has been regarded
with peculiar interest. Of the four great elements so essential
to life—earth, air, water, fire—the last has often been considered
as divine in its origin and influence. To the unscientific observer
it seems more than matter, and little less than spirit.
Contemplating a flame, he sees that while it has form, it lacks
solidity. He may pass a sword through it, but like the ghost
of the story, no wound is made in its ethereal substance. Its
touch is softer than down, but it penetrates the hardest substances.
The diamond carves glass, but flame destroys the
diamond.</p>

<p>Men early found that fire was directly connected with their
comfort and progress, and even essential to their existence.
How they first obtained it is still matter of conjecture; whether
it was brought down from the skies, as the ancient Greeks
supposed, struck out from the flinty rock, evolved by the friction
of dry wood, kindled by the lightning, or obtained from
the flaming torch of the volcano, we can not tell.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that having once been obtained, all the early
races were very careful to preserve it. Among many it was
regarded as sacred, and kept perpetually burning, both in
their places of worship and in their homes. The officers appointed
for its preservation were of the highest rank and influence.
Among the titles assumed by Augustus Cæsar was that
of keeper of the public fire. Whenever by accident the fire in
the temple of Vesta, at Rome, was extinguished, all public
business was at once suspended, because the connection between
heaven and earth was believed to be severed, and must
be restored before business could properly proceed.</p>

<p>Grecian colonists carried fire to their new homes from the
altar of Hestia. The “Prytaneum”<a href="#chem1" id="anch_chem1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the ancient Greeks
and Romans was a place where the national fire was kept always
burning; it was here the people gathered, foreign ambassadors
received, and hospitalities of the state were offered.
Here, too, heads of families obtained coals for lighting their
household fires, which in turn became sacred, so that every
hearth was an altar, where resided the Lares and Penates, the
gods who presided over the welfare of the home.</p>

<p>Fancies akin to these beliefs of olden time may still be found
among the nations of the East and in northern Europe.</p>

<h3>MODERN FALLACIES.</h3>

<p>No correct ideas of combustion were attained until the
time of Lavoisier.<a href="#chem2" id="anch_chem2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This great French savant gave precision
and accuracy to the investigations of chemical science
by the introduction of the balance. He disproved the
theory that “water is the ultimate principle of all things,”
and prepared the way for a clear apprehension of the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that matter, though constantly changing its form, is never
destroyed. He also announced the correct theory of combustion.
Until this time scientists had held what was called
the “Phlogiston<a href="#chem3" id="anch_chem3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Theory.” We can but smile at the absurdity
of this belief, and yet no hypothesis was ever taught more
positively, or maintained more tenaciously. It declared, in
brief, that when substances burned, they parted with a certain
material called phlogiston. When, at length, its advocates
were asked to explain the fact, discovered by Dr. Priestly,<a href="#chem5" id="anch_chem5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
that quicksilver, when burned, weighed more than before, they
were forced to put forward the ridiculous statement that phlogiston
possessed the property of “buoyancy” so that when it
was contained in a body its weight was lessened; which was as
wise as the brilliant supposition that a person can lift himself
over a fence by tugging at his boot straps. After a fierce
struggle they were forced to confess that they had placed “the
cart before the horse.” The truth was precisely opposite to
their statement. Substances when they burn take up something
instead of giving it off. That something is oxygen, and a body
when burned, if it can be weighed, will be found to weigh as
much more as the added weight of the oxygen which has united
with it. Example: Iron-rust is iron, plus oxygen.</p>

<h3>THE TRUE EXPLANATION.</h3>

<p>We shall here confine ourselves to the consideration of the
heat and light produced by chemical action. It will be remembered
that by this term (chemical action) is meant the
process of uniting two or more different elements to form a
compound different from either. We usually consider air essential
to combustion, but this is not necessarily the fact.
Gold foil or powdered antimony, dropped into a jar of chlorine,
spontaneously ignites. Even in the interior of the earth, heat
must be produced by the uniting of any elements that have an
affinity for each other.</p>

<p class="caption">BORACIC ACID IMPARTS A GREEN COLOR TO THE FLAME OF ALCOHOL.<a href="#chem6" id="anch_chem6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The most common agent of combustion is oxygen. Of this
interesting gas some description has been given in a preceding
article. It is the fruitful source of almost all of our artificial
heat.</p>

<p>The fallen tree in the forest is slowly consumed by it, not
less surely than the flaming wood and coal in our stoves. The
human body is a furnace. In the minute corpuscles<a href="#chem7" id="anch_chem7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the
blood, carbon is uniting with oxygen as certainly as are the
particles of carbon in the flame of our lamps.</p>

<p>Oxygen is the scavenger that partially cleans our gutters.
It is a bird of prey that devours the offal in our fields and
woods. It is nothing less than the gnawing tooth of old Father
Time himself, which crumbles cities and destroys all things.</p>

<p>Combustion, as we now know it, consists simply in the union
of some combustible material with oxygen. The generic term
for all this action is “oxidation.” For convenience, special
names are given to particular modes. When metallic oxidation
occurs we call the product “rusting.” When oxygen unites
with vegetable matter we call it decaying or rotting; when with
animal substances we term it rotting or putrefaction. When
flame is produced, the word combustion or burning is used.
The amount of heat generated is, in all cases, proportioned to
the amount of chemical action. Great ingenuity and skill have
been shown in the discovery and utilization of materials best
calculated to combine readily with oxygen. To these, as a
class, has been applied the term</p>

<h3>HYDRO-CARBONS.</h3>

<p>All substances composed essentially of the elements, hydrogen
and carbon, would come under this designation. These
would include coal, wood, petroleum, the fats, resins, wax and
many others, with some of the gases, among which may be
named light and heavy carburetted hydrogen, CH₄ and C₂H₄
respectively.</p>

<p>In the days of our grandfathers tallow candles were almost
universally employed for lighting houses, and wood for warming
them. It would not be impossible to find even now, in
our own country, homes illuminated (?) by a rag burning in a
saucer of fat. Some of us are not too young to remember the
bundle of candle-rods—nice, straight sticks used in dipping
candles—snugly put away for that purpose, alas! sometimes
summoned forth to assist in enforcing family discipline!</p>

<p class="caption">GREEN FIRE COLORED BY A SALT OF BARIUM.<a href="#chem9" id="anch_chem9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Strands of twisted cotton wick were suspended from these
sticks, and successively dipped into a kettle of hot tallow, until
external additions made them of the requisite size. Tin candle
moulds finally superseded these. Then the wick was suspended
in the center and the fat poured in. In cooling, the
candles contracted, and so slipped easily from the moulds.
Wax candles can not be cast in moulds, as they expand in
cooling. They are made by pouring successive additions
upon them. They are afterward given symmetrical form by
rolling and shaping. Along the sea coast I have seen women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and children gathering bay berries,<a href="#chem10" id="anch_chem10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a fruit about as large as a
grain of black pepper and covered with a grayish-white, fragrant
wax. When these seeds are placed in hot water the wax
dissolves and serves the same purpose as tallow, making delightfully
aromatic candles.</p>

<p>Many of the hydro-carbons possess an agreeable odor. Sometimes
the woodmen gather the bark and chips of the hickory
to smoke hams and shoulders on account of the peculiarly
pleasant flavor they impart. In burning, a candle or lamp
becomes a gas factory, manufacturing and consuming its own
product. The flame consists of three cones. The first, that
next to the wick, is composed solely of gas. It is not hot, as
can be shown by thrusting the end of a match into it, the
match will not ignite. If the match be placed across the flame
at the same point it will burn at the edges, but not in the center.
A more striking illustration of the fact that the flame is hot only
where it comes in contact with the air, can be shown in the following
manner: Place on the bottom of an inverted plate some
alcohol, in the center set a tiny saucer containing powder; ignite
the alcohol, and the powder will remain undisturbed in
the center of the surrounding flame until a draft brings the
<i>edge</i> of the flame against the powder, when it will at once explode.</p>

<p>Look steadily at the flame of an ordinary candle and you
can readily discern the three cones; the first is gas, the second
gas in rapid combination with the oxygen of the air, the third
the products of this combination—watery vapor, carbonic anhydride,
and, possibly, some unconsumed carbon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus022.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RED FIRE COLORED BY A SALT OF STRONTIUM.<a href="#chem11" id="anch_chem11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The process that goes on in our stoves is essentially the
same. The carbon and hydrogen of the wood or coal unite
with the oxygen that passes through the draft. Now note a
wonderful provision for our comfort. It has already been remarked
that the product of combustion consists of the thing
burned, plus oxygen. Suppose, in the case of our fires, this
product were a solid, we should then be forced to take out of
the stove more material than we put in. The Creator has,
however, provided that these resulting materials shall take the
form of gas or vapor, so that they can float away. The ashes
that remain form but a small part of the whole. The two most
common products of combustion are watery vapor and carbonic
anhydride.</p>

<p>The illumination of our towns and cities has long been accomplished
by the use of gas manufactured from coal. Bituminous
coal is used for this purpose, and the process consists
in heating it to destructive distillation, and afterward condensing
and absorbing such portions of the volatilized materials as
might clog the gas pipes or interfere with perfect combustion.</p>

<p>Nature, it is now known, has her own gas works, on an immense
scale. Thirty-five years ago the village of Fredonia,
N. Y., was partially lighted with gas, and the supply is still unexhausted.
Indeed, of late, many private individuals have
sunk pipes two or three hundred feet, and thus supplied their
homes with gas for illuminating, heating, and cooking purposes.
In Butler and McKean counties, Pennsylvania, the production of
these gas wells is enormous. Many have been burning day and
night for years, while others have been utilized for heating and
lighting towns and cities. Gas is now extensively used in rolling
mills for smelting iron. Petroleum, or rock oil, which is usually
associated with this natural gas, has now become of immense
value to this and other lands. It is one of the chief articles
of export from this country, ranking perhaps as fourth.
Wells have recently been struck in Pennsylvania that flowed
5,000 and 6,000 barrels per day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="caption">SODIUM BURNING ON HOT WATER.<a href="#chem12" id="anch_chem12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is reason to believe that this material is the product
of distillation of organic matter in the earth. It is found in
porous rock, usually coarse sand, at depths varying from
three hundred to two thousand feet. When the rock above the
sand containing oil is tight, the gas is often retained, which by
its expansion presses upon the oil and forces it to the surface
through the pipes put down for this purpose. This produces a
flowing well. When the gas has escaped a pump is necessary.</p>

<p>The most useful hydro-carbon now employed is coal. Its
use was first introduced in the latter part of the twelfth century,
and as late as the thirteenth century petitions were made by
residents of London demanding its exclusion, on account of its
injurious effect on the health. But now, Great Britain mines
annually more than one hundred million tons of coal. Its
uses are manifold. By it England has multiplied her power a
thousand fold. It is almost always employed in generating
steam, and the aggregate steam power of England is equal to
the productive laboring force of four hundred millions of men,
or “twice the power of the adult working population of the
globe.” Most countries know its value.</p>

<p>Coal is the key that unlocks for us the treasures of the iron
ore. It seizes upon the oxygen in the ore, and liberates the
pure metal. By a wonderful provision they often exist in the
same mountain, side by side. I have seen in Pennsylvania,
running out of the same tunnel in the hills, car loads of coal
and iron ore.</p>

<p>Among the many advantages possessed by our own country
is our immense store of this precious hydro-carbon. With
an area of 300,000,000 miles of territory, we have more than
200,000 square miles of known coal producing area, or one in
fifteen.</p>

<p>Great Britain has one-half of the coal fields of all Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
but even she has but one square mile of coal to twenty square
miles of territory. Beside, our coal seams are of great thickness,
and lie comparatively near the surface. In the far West,
vast fields of lignite<a href="#chem14" id="anch_chem14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> have been discovered, so that there
seems no prospect of our exhausting our fuel supply for ages
to come.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.—PROHIBITION.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Rugged or not, there is no other way.”—<i>Luther.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The champions of temperance have to contend with two
chief adversaries—ignorance and organized crime. The well-organized
liquor league can boast of leaders whose want of
principles is not extenuated by want of information, and who
deliberately scheme to coin the misery of their fellowmen
into dollars and cents. But the machinations of such enemies
of mankind would not have availed them against the power of
public opinion, if their cunning had not found a potent ally in
the ignorance, not of their victims only, but of their passive
opponents. We need the moral and intellectual support of a
larger class of our fellow-citizens, before we can hope to secure
the effectual aid of legal remedies, and in that direction the
chief obstacles to the progress of our cause have been the prevailing
misconceptions on the following points:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Competence of Legislative Power.</span>—There can be no
doubt that the legislative authority even of civilized governments
has been frequently misapplied. The most competent
exponents of political economy agree that the state has no
business to meddle in such affairs as the fluctuation of market
prices, the rate of interest, the freedom of international traffic.
On more than one occasion European governments, having
attempted to regulate the price of bread-stuffs, etc., were
taught the folly of such interference by commercial dead-locks
and the impossibility of procuring the necessaries of life at the
prescribed price, and were thus compelled to remedy the mischief
by repealing their enactments. Usury laws tend to increase,
instead of decreasing, the rate of interest, by obliging
the usurer to indemnify himself for the disadvantage of the
additional risk. The attempt to increase national revenues by
enforcing an artificial balance of trade has ever defeated its
own object. It is almost equally certain that compulsory
charities do on the whole more harm than good. On the other
hand, there are no more undoubtedly legitimate functions of government
than the suppression, and the, if possible, prevention,
of crime, and the enforcement of health laws; and it can be
demonstrated by every rule of logic and equity that the liquor
traffic can be held amenable in both respects. The favorite
argument of our opponents is the distinction of crime and vice.
For the latter, they tell us, society has no remedy, except in
as much as the natural consequences (disease, destitution,
etc.) are apt to recoil on the person of the perpetrator; the
evil of intemperance therefore is beyond the reach of the law.
We may fully concede the premises without admitting the cogency
of the conclusion. The suspected possession or private
use of intoxicating liquors would hardly justify the issue of a
search warrant, but the penalties of the law can with full justice
be directed against the manufacturer or vender who seeks
gain by tempting his fellowmen to indulge in a poison infallibly
injurious in any quantity, and infallibly tending to the development
of a body and soul corrupting habit; they may with
equal justice be directed against the consumer, stupefied or
brutalized by the effects of that poison. The rumseller has no
right to plead the consent of his victim. The absence of
violence or “malice prepense,”<a href="#science1" id="anch_science1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is a plea that would legalize
some of the worst offenses against society. The peddler of
obscene literature poisons the souls of our children without a
shadow of ill-will against his individual customer. The gambler,
the lottery-shark, use no manner of force in the pursuit of
their prey. By what logic can we justify the interdiction of
their industry and condemn that of the liquor traffic? By the
criterion of comparative harmlessness? Have all the indecencies
published since the invention of printing occasioned
the thousandth part of the misery caused by the yearly and
inevitable consequences of the poison vice? The lottery
player may lose or win, but the customer of the liquor vender
is doomed to loss as soon as he approaches the dram-shop.
The damage sustained by the habitual player may be confined
to a loss of money, while the habitual drunkard is sure to suffer
in health, character and reputation, as well as in purse. And
shall we condone the conduct of the befuddled drunkard on
account of a temporary suspense of conscious reason? That
very <i>dementation</i> constitutes his offense.</p>

<p>His actions may or may not result in actual mischief, but he
has put the decision of that event beyond his control. The
man who gallops headlong through crowded streets is punished
for his reckless disregard of other men’s safety, though
the hoofs of his horse may have failed to inflict any actual injury.
A menagerie keeper would be arrested, if not lynched,
for turning a city into a pandemonium by letting loose his bears
and hyenas, and for the same reason no man should be permitted
to turn himself into a wild beast.</p>

<p>“Virtue must come from within,” says Prof. Newman;<a href="#science2" id="anch_science2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “to
this problem religion and morality must direct themselves.
But vice may come from without; to <i>hinder</i> this is the care of
the statesman.” And here, as elsewhere, prevention is better
than cure. By obviating the temptations of the dram-shop a
progressive vice with an incalculable train of mischievous
consequences may be nipped in the bud. Penal legislation is
a sham if it takes cognizance of moral evils only after they
have passed the curable stage. “It is mere mockery,” says
Cardinal Manning,<a href="#science3" id="anch_science3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “to ask us to put down drunkenness
by moral and religious means, when the legislature facilitates
the multiplication of the incitements to intemperance on every
side. You might as well call upon me as a captain of a ship
and say: ‘Why don’t you pump the water out when it is sinking,’
when you are scuttling the ship in every direction. If
you will cut off the supply of temptation, I will be bound by
the help of God to convert drunkards, but until you have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
off this perpetual supply of intoxicating drink we never can
cultivate the fields. Let the legislature do its part and we will
answer for the rest.”</p>

<p>All civilized nations have recognized not only the right but
the duty of legislative authorities to adopt the most stringent
measures for the prevention of contagious disease; yet all epidemics
taken together have not caused half as much loss of
life and health as the plague of the poison vice.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Magnitude of the Evil.</span>—Since health and freedom began
to be recognized as the primary conditions of human welfare,
the conviction is gaining ground that the principles of our
legislative system need a general revision. It was a step in
the right direction when the lawgivers of the Middle Ages began
to realize the truth that the liberty of individual action
should be sacrificed only to urgent consideration of public
welfare, but the modified theories on the comparative importance
of these considerations have inaugurated a still more
important reform. Penal codes gradually ceased to enforce
ceremonies and abstruse dogmas and to ignore monstrous
municipal and sanitary abuses. The time has passed when
legislators raged with extreme penalties against the propagandists
of speculative theories and ignored the propagation
of slum diseases, yet, after all, there is still a lingering belief
in the minds of many contemporaries that intemperance, as a
physical evil, a “mere dietetic excess,” does not justify the invasion
of personal liberty. They would consent to restrict the
freedom of thought and speech rather than the license of the
rum-dealer, yet the tendency of a progressive advance in public
opinion promises the advent of a time when that license
will appear the chief anomaly of the present age. The numberless
minute prescriptions and interdicts of our law books
and their silence on the crime of the liquor traffic will make it
difficult for coming ages to comprehend the intellectual status
of a generation that could wage such uncompromising war
against microscopic gnats and consent to gratify the greed of
a monstrous vampire.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Self-correcting Abuses.</span>—Modern physicians admit
that various forms of disease which were formerly treated with
drastic drugs can be safely trusted to the healing agencies of
nature. Many social evils, too, tend to work out their own
cure. High markets encourage competition and have led to
a reduction of prices. Luxury leads to enforced economy by
reducing the resources of the spendthrift. Dishonest tradesmen
lose custom, and a German government that used to fine
editors for publishing unverified rumors might have left it to
the subscribers to withdraw their patronage from a purveyor
of unreliable news. But there are certain causes of disease
that demand the interference of art. <i>Poisons</i>, especially, require
artificial antidotes. If a child has mistaken arsenic for sugar,
its life commonly depends on the timely arrival of a physician.
The organism may rid itself of a surfeit, but is unable to eliminate
the virus of a skin disease. Alcoholism belongs to the
same class of disorders. We need not legislate against corsets;
the absurdities of fashion change and vanish like fleeting
clouds, and their votaries may welcome the change; but
drunkards would remain slaves of their vice though the verdict
of public opinion should have made dram-drinking extremely
unfashionable. The morbid passion transmitted from
sire to son, and strengthened by years of indulgence, would
defy all moral restraints and yield only to the practical impossibility
to obtain the object of its desire.</p>

<p>“A number of years ago,” says Dr. Isaac Jennings, “I was
called to the shipyard in Derby, to see John B., a man about
thirty years of age, of naturally stout, robust constitution, who
had fallen from a scaffold in a fit, head first upon a spike below.
In my visit to dress the wounded head, I spoke to him of the
folly and danger of continuing to indulge his habit of drinking,
and obtained from him a promise that he would abandon it.
Not long after I learned that he was drinking again, and reminded
him of his promise. His excuse was, that it would
not do for him to abandon the practice of drinking suddenly.
A few weeks after this he called at my office and requested me
to bleed him, or do something to prevent a fit, for he felt much
as he did a short time before having the last fit. I said to him,
‘John, sit down here with me and let us consider your case a
little.’ I drew two pictures and held before him; one presented
a wife and three little children with a circle of friends
made happy and himself respectable and useful in society; the
other, a wretched family, and himself mouldering in a drunkard’s
grave; and appealed to him to decide which should
prove to be the true picture. The poor fellow burst into tears
and wept like a child. When he had recovered himself from
sobbing so that he could speak he said: ‘Doctor, to tell you the
truth, it is not that I am afraid of the consequences of stopping
suddenly that I do not give up drinking. <i>I can not do it.</i> I
have tried and tried again, but it is all in vain. Sometimes I
have gone a number of weeks without drinking, and I flattered
myself that the temptation was gone, but it returned, and now
if there was a spot on earth where men lived and could not
get spirits, and I could get there, I would start in a minute.’ I
thought I had understood something of the difficulties of hard
drinkers before, but this gave me a new impression of the matter,
and most solemnly did I charge myself to do what I could
to <i>make a spot on earth where men could live and couldn’t get
spirits</i>.”</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Lesser Evils.</span>—Even in a stricter form than any rational
friend of temperance would desire its enforcement, prohibition
would not involve any consequences that could possibly make
the cure a greater evil than the disease. The predicted aching
void resulting from the expurgation of beer-tunnels could
be filled by healthier means of recreation. The grief of the
superseded poison-mongers would not outweigh the mountain-load
of misery and woe which the abolishment of their cursed
trade would lift from the shoulders of the nation. When the
state of Iowa declared for prohibition the opponents of that
amendment bemoaned the loss entailed by the departure of
“so many industrious and respectable citizens,” <i>i. e.</i>, from the
exodus of the rumsellers! We might just as well be asked to
bewail the doom of the Thugs<a href="#science4" id="anch_science4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as the subversion of a prosperous
industry. We might as well be requested to sympathize
with the respectable bloodhound-trainers and knout-manufacturers
whom the abolition of slavery threw out of employment.
The liquor dealer has no right to complain about the rigor of
a law that permits him to depart with the spoils of such a
trade. We are told that the mere rumor of Maine laws has
deterred many foreigners from making their homes with us;
that the Russian peasants decline to come without their brewers
and distillers, and that by general prohibition we would
risk to reduce our immigration from every country of northern
Europe. We must take that risk, and let Muscovites rot in the
bogs of the Volga if they can not accept our hospitality without
turning our bread corn into poison. Our utilitarian friends
would hardly persuade us to legalize cannibalism in order to encourage
a larger immigration of Fiji islanders. The absence
of such guests might not prove an unqualified evil. I shall
not insult the intelligence of my readers by repeating the drivel
of the wretches who would weigh the reduction of revenues
against the happiness of a hell-delivered nation, and I will
only mention the reply of a British financier who estimates
that the increase of national prosperity would offset that reduction
<i>in less than five years</i>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Efficacy of Prohibition.</span>—Will prohibition prevent
the use of intoxicating liquor? Not wholly, but it will answer
its purpose. It will banish distilleries to secret mountain glens
and hidden cellars. It will drive the man-traps of the poison-monger
from the public streets. It will save our boys from a
hundred temptations; it will help thousands of reformed
drunkards to keep their pledge; it will restore peace and
plenty to many hundred thousand homes. More than a century
ago the philosopher Leibnitz<a href="#science5" id="anch_science5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> maintained that the plenary suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of the liquor traffic would be the most effectual means
for reforming the moral status of civilized nations, and experience
has since fully demonstrated the correctness of that opinion.
A memorandum endorsed by a large number of statistical
vouchers describes the effect of prohibition in Sweden:
“The nation rose and fell, grew prosperous and happy, or miserable
and degraded, as its rulers and law-makers restrained
or permitted the manufacture and sale of that which all along
the track of its history has seemed to be the nation’s greatest
curse.” … “The vigorously maintained prohibition
against spirits in 1753-1756, and again in 1772-1775, proved the
enormous benefits effected in moral, economical, and other respects,
by abstinence from intoxicating spirits.” …
“This it is which has so helped Sweden to emerge from moral
and material prostration, and explains the existence of such
general indications in that country of comfort and independence
among all classes.”</p>

<p>From the Edinburgh <i>Review</i> for January, 1873, we learn that
in eighty-nine private estates in England and Scotland, “the
drink traffic has been altogether suppressed, with the happiest
social results. The late Lord Palmerston<a href="#science6" id="anch_science6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> suppressed the beer
shops in Romsey as the leases fell in. We know an estate
which stretches for miles along the romantic shore of Loch
Fyne,<a href="#science7" id="anch_science7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where no whiskey is allowed to be sold. The peasants
and fishermen are flourishing. They have all their money in
the bank, and they obtain higher wages than their neighbors
when they go to sea”—a proof that a small oasis of temperance
can maintain its prosperity in the midst of poison-blighted
communities.</p>

<p>Here and there the wiles of the poison-mongers will undoubtedly
succeed in evading the law, but their power for
mischief will be diminished as that of the gambling-hell was
diminished in Homburg and Baden,<a href="#science8" id="anch_science8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where temptation was removed
out of the track of the uninitiated till the host of victims
dwindled away for want of recruits. Not the promptings of
an innate passion, but the charm of artificial allurements is
the gate by which ninety-nine out of a hundred drunkards have
entered the road to ruin. It would be an understatement to
say that the temptation of minors will be reduced a hundred
fold wherever the total amount of sales has been reduced
as much as five fold—a result which has been far exceeded,
even under the present imperfect system of legal control. “In
the course of my duty as an Internal Revenue officer,” says
Superintendent Hamlin of Bangor, “I have become thoroughly
acquainted with the state and extent of the liquor traffic in
Maine, and I have no hesitation in saying that the beer trade
is not more than one per cent. of what I remember it to have
been, and the trade in distilled liquors is not more than ten per
cent. of what it was formerly.” “I think I am justified in saying,”
reports the Attorney-General, “that there is not an open
bar for the sale of intoxicating liquor in this county” (Androscoggin,
including the manufacturing district of Lewiston—once
a very hotbed of the rum traffic). “In the city of Biddeford, a
manufacturing place of 11,000 inhabitants, for a month at a
time not a single arrest for drunkenness has been made or become
necessary.” And from Augusta (the capital of the state):
“If we were to say that the quantity of liquor sold here is not
one-tenth as large as formerly, we think it would be within the
truth; and the favorable effects of the change upon all the interests
of the state are plainly seen everywhere.”</p>

<p>“It is perhaps not necessary,” says the Boston <i>Globe</i>, of July
29, 1875, “to dwell on the evils of intemperance, and yet people
seldom think how great a proportion of these might be prevented
by driving the iniquity into its hiding places, and preventing
it from coming forth to lure its victims from among
the unwary and comparatively guileless. Few young men
who are worth saving, or are likely to be saved to decency and
virtue, would seek it out if it were kept from sight. But when
it comes forth in gay and alluring colors, it draws a procession
of our youth into a path that has an awful termination. Nor
does the evil which springs from an open toleration of the way
in which this vice carries on its traffic of destruction fall only
on men. A sad proportion of its victims is made up from
shop girls and abandoned women who are not so infatuated at
the start that they would plunge into a life of infamy if its
temptations were strictly under the ban, and kept widely separated
from the world of decency. But it intruded itself upon
them. Its temptations and opportunities are before their eyes,
and the way is made easy for their feet to go down to death.”</p>

<p>“To what good is it,” says Lord Brougham,<a href="#science9" id="anch_science9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> “that the legislature
should pass laws to punish crime, or that their lordships
should occupy themselves in trying to improve the morals of
the people by giving them education? What could be the use
of sowing a little seed here and plucking up a weed there, if
these beer shops are to be continued to sow the seeds of immorality
broadcast over the land, germinating the most frightful
produce that ever has been allowed to grow up in a civilized
country, and, I am ashamed to add, under the fostering
care of Parliament.”</p>

<p>The prohibition of the poison traffic has become the urgent
duty of every legislator, the foremost aim of every moral reformer.
The verdict of the most eminent statesmen, physicians,
clergymen, patriots and philanthropists, is unanimous on
that point. We lack energy, not competence, nor the sanction
of a higher authority, to gain the votes of the masses.</p>

<p>“We can prove the success of prohibition by the experience
of our neighboring state,” writes Dr. Herbert Buchanan, of
Portsmouth, New Hampshire; “all the vicious elements of society
are arraigned against us, <i>but I have no fear of the event
if we do not cease to agitate the subject</i>.”</p>

<p>Agitation, a ceaseless appeal to the common sense and conscience
of our fellowmen can, indeed, not fail to be crowned
with ultimate success. The struggle with vice, with ignorance
and mean selfishness may continue, but it will be our own
fault if our adversaries can support their opposition by a single
valid argument, and the battle will be more than half won
if a majority of our fellow-citizens have to admit that we contend
no longer for a favor, but for an evident right.</p>

<h3>V. TEA, COFFEE, AND CHOCOLATE.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BYRON D. HALSTED, SC. D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>We have here to consider the sources of the three leading
dietetic beverages. They are very unlike in general appearance,
but all possess the same vegetable principle, called an
alkaloid,<a href="#kitchen1" id="anch_kitchen1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> though known under different names. Thus modern
chemistry has proved the identity of the theine of the tea,
the caffeine<a href="#kitchen2" id="anch_kitchen2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the coffee and the theo-bromine<a href="#kitchen3" id="anch_kitchen3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the chocolate.
This same vegetable alkaloid, remarkable for its large
per cent. of nitrogen, is found in small quantities in a few other
plants, most of which have been used to some extent for the
making of an exhilarating drink. It answers our purpose best
to treat each of our three subjects under its respective head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tea</span> (<i>Thea viridis</i><a href="#kitchen4" id="anch_kitchen4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>).—The tea of commerce is the prepared
leaves of a shrub belonging to the order Camelliaceæ<a href="#kitchen5" id="anch_kitchen5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> represented
in the United States by loblolly bay<a href="#kitchen6" id="anch_kitchen6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Stuartia.<a href="#kitchen7" id="anch_kitchen7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Perhaps the most familiar near relative of the tea plant is the
camellia of our green houses and window gardens. The wild
tea shrub grows from twenty to thirty feet high, and is found
native in China and Japan. When under cultivation the shrub
is pruned so as to not exceed six feet in height. The flowers
are large, white and fragrant; they are produced in clusters in
the axils of the simple, oblong, evergreen, serrate leaves. China
and Japan are among the leading tea-growing countries, its
cultivation being chiefly confined between twenty-five and
thirty-five north latitude. Tea was in general use in China in
the ninth century, but it was not until the seventeenth century
that it was introduced into Europe. About the middle of this
century the East India Company imported tea into England,
since which time it has become the regular beverage of many
millions of people in all parts of the world. The importations
of tea into the United States for the year ending June 30th, 1884,
were 67,665,910 pounds. It will be seen that this gives somewhere
near a pound and a quarter of tea for each man, woman
and child in this country. Most of our China tea trade is carried
on with Shanghai, Foo Chow and Amoy.</p>

<p>In China the tea shrub is grown chiefly on the southern slopes
of hills in poor, well watered soil, to which manure is applied.
The seeds are dropped in holes at regular intervals, and during
the third year the first crop is obtained. In from seven to ten
years the shrubs are cut down and shoots spring up from the
stumps, which continue to yield crops of leaves. A single plant
produces on an average between three hundred and three hundred
and fifty pounds of dried leaves. The leaves are picked three
times a year, in April, May, and June or July. The young,
tender leaves of the first gathering make the best tea, and this
is very largely consumed in its native country. The older
leaves of the second and third pickings make a poorer quality
of tea which abounds in tannin,<a href="#kitchen8" id="anch_kitchen8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and contains but a small
per cent. of the best elements of superior tea. It was long
supposed that black and green sorts of tea were made from
distinct varieties, or even species of plants; in fact, there has
been a great deal of mystery surrounding the culture and
preparation of tea until within the past score of years. Authorities
now state that there is only one species of plant yielding
tea leaves, and from this all sorts are made. The differences
are natural, being some of them due to climate and conditions
of soil, etc., while others are the result of the manipulation
of the leaves after they are gathered. Black and green
tea may come from the same shrub, or even the same branch of
a plant. The leaves forming black tea undergo a fermentation
before they are dried, while those designed for green tea are
at once submitted to a high heat in iron pans, and not copper
pans, as generally supposed. After the leaves for black tea
have been gathered they are placed in heaps, when they become
flaccid and turn dark from incipient fermentation. The
leaves are then rolled between the thumb and fingers or upon
bamboo tables until the desired twist is obtained. They next
pass to a drying room and are heated in an iron pan; again
twisted, and afterward dried over a slow fire. The principal
difference between the preparation of black and green tea is that
in the latter the freshly gathered leaves go at once into the
heated pans. The repeated twisting and heating is nearly the
same with both classes. The green teas are sometimes artificially
colored by using turmeric<a href="#kitchen9" id="anch_kitchen9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with gypsum or Prussian
blue. A flavor is frequently given to the tea by adding aromatic
flowers, as those of the pekoe and caper.<a href="#kitchen10" id="anch_kitchen10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Among the
leading varieties of black tea are: Bohea, a small leaf, crisp
and strong odor, with brackish taste; two sorts of Congous—the
large leaf with fine flavor, and the small leaf with a burnt
smell. The Souchong is the much prized “English Breakfast,”
made from leaves of three-year-old trees. Only a small
part of the so-called Souchong is genuine. Pekoe is made
from the tenderest leaves gathered from three-year-old plants
while in bloom. Oolongs are common kinds of black teas,
much used for mixing with other sorts. Of the green teas the
Gunpowder is round, like shot, with green color and fragrant
taste. The Imperial is more loosely rolled than the Gunpowder.
Young Hyson is in loose rolls, which easily crumble to the
touch; it gives a light green infusion. Old Hyson is the older
leaves in the picking for Young Hyson. Twankay consists of
mixed and broken leaves, and is of inferior quality. Japan
teas are both colored and uncolored, and come from Japan;
they are very largely consumed in this country.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of a fair sample of tea is; Theine,
1. to 3. per cent.; caseine,<a href="#kitchen11" id="anch_kitchen11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> 15.; gum, 18.; sugar, .3; tannin,
26.; aromatic oil, .75; fat, 4.; vegetable fiber, 20.; mineral substances,
5.; and water, 5. per cent.</p>

<p>The tannin is an astringent, while the theine acts as a gentle
excitant upon the nervous system. This is probably enhanced
by the warmth of the infusion. The best authorities agree that
tea is a valuable article of diet for healthy, grown people. It
however is not suitable for children until growth is completed.
Adults with irritable constitutions may be injured by tea-drinking.
Tea is the solace of old age. Cibber<a href="#kitchen12" id="anch_kitchen12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> wrote: “Tea!
thou soft, thou sober, sage and venerable liquid … thou
female tongue-running, smile-smoothing, heart-opening, wink-tippling
cordial, to whose glorious insipidity I owe the happiest
moments of my life, let me fall prostrate.” Waller<a href="#kitchen13" id="anch_kitchen13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> truthfully
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tea doth our fancy aid,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Repress those vapors which the head invade</div>
<div class="verse i1">And keep the palace of the soul.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tea is extensively adulterated in many ways. In China exhausted
tea leaves and foliage of other trees are employed by
millions of pounds each year. Willow leaves are among the
principal ones used for mixing with tea. A British consul once
related that at Shanghai there were at one time 53,000 pounds
of willow leaves in preparation to be sold as tea. Mineral
matters are used to color or “face” the tea. “The common
test,” states Mr. Felker, in his work “What the Grocers Sell
Us,” “is by infusion; this is poured off the leaves and examined
for color, taste, and odor, all of which are characteristic.…
Impurities like sand, iron filings and dirt may be seen among
the leaves or at the bottom of the cups. The leaves, too, betray
by their coarseness and botanical character, the nature
and quality of the tea, for although the leaves of the genuine
tea differ much in form and size, yet their venation and general
structure are very distinctive.… ‘Lie tea,’ used to
adulterate Gunpowder tea, consists of tea dust mixed with mineral
substances, starch and gum, and then formed into little
masses resembling tea.” Large tea houses employ professional
tea tasters who make steepings and judge upon the flavor,
purity, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span>—The coffee of commerce is the seed of a shrub,
<i>Coffea Arabica</i>,<a href="#kitchen14" id="anch_kitchen14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> belonging to the order Rubiaceæ,<a href="#kitchen15" id="anch_kitchen15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which is
represented in the United States by the charming little
“bluets” of our pastures in spring. The cape jessamine and
bouvardias<a href="#kitchen16" id="anch_kitchen16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of the green house are near relatives of the coffee
plant. The name coffee is probably derived from the Arabic
word <i>Kahwah</i>, although some authorities contend that it is
traced to Caffa, a province of Abyssinia, where the coffee plant
flourishes in the wild state. The coffee shrub is an evergreen,
growing to the height of twenty feet, with long, smooth, shining
leaves. The pure white flowers are produced in clusters in the
axils of the leaves and followed by fleshy berries which, when
ripe, resemble small, dark red cherries. Each berry usually
contains two seeds embedded in the yellowish pulp. These
seeds, when separated from the pulp and papery covering,
form the raw coffee of the stores. Each seed—improperly
called a berry—is somewhat hemispherical, with a groove
running through the middle of the flat side. Sometimes one
seed is abortive in the berry, and the other becomes round, as
in the Wynaad coffee from India, sometimes called “male
berry” coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Coffee is cultivated in many countries lying between fifteen
north and fifteen south latitude. It may be successfully grown
thirty degrees from the equator. Like the tea plant, the coffee
shrub favors the well watered mountain slopes. The trees are set
in long, straight rows, six feet apart, and six feet from each other
in the row. The coffee tree is naturally a plant with long,
straggling shoots, but under cultivation it is pruned to make a
shrub not exceeding six feet in height, with long, lateral
branches. A full crop should be obtained the third year. The
berries are gathered when the pulp begins to shrivel, and are
at once taken to the store-house, where they are pulped. The
berries are passed between large, rough rollers, which remove
the pulp, but not the parchment-like covering of the seeds.
The berries with the pulp removed are heaped up, covered
with old sacking, and allowed to ferment for two days. Water
is turned on and all glutinous matter removed. The seeds are
spread out to dry, after which they are passed between wooden
cylinders that remove the thin, dry covering. The coffee
seeds, after being winnowed, are assorted into various sizes
and packed ready for shipment. A thrifty shrub yields two
pounds of marketable coffee. The raw coffee seed has a horny
texture, without the peculiar aroma characteristic of the roasted
berry.</p>

<p>The early history of coffee is obscure. It has been in use for
over a thousand years. The knowledge of its use was first
brought into Arabia from Abyssinia in the fifteenth century.
“Its peculiar property of dissipating drowsiness and preventing
sleep was taken advantage of in connection with the prolonged
religious services of the Mohametans, and its use as a
devotional antisoporific stirred up a fierce opposition on the
part of the priests. Coffee was by them held to be an intoxicant
beverage, and therefore prohibited by the Koran;<a href="#kitchen17" id="anch_kitchen17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and
the dreadful penalties of an outraged sacred law were laid over
the heads of all who became addicted to its use. Notwithstanding
the threats of divine retribution, and though all
manner of devices were adopted to check its growth, the
coffee-drinking habit spread rapidly among the Arabians, Mohametans,
and the growth of coffee as well as its use as a national
beverage became as inseparably associated with Arabia
as tea is with China.” Coffee reached Great Britain in the
seventeenth century. Charles II. attempted to suppress coffee
houses by proclamation, because they “devised and spread
abroad divers false, malicious and scandalous reports to the
defamation of his Majesty’s government and to the peace and
quiet of the nation.” How different is this view from that held
by those interested in good government, peace and prosperity
at the present day! We now rejoice in the establishment of
coffee houses, hoping that they may supplant the much dreaded
rum shops.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note here that the three dietetic beverages
treated in this article were all introduced into Europe at nearly
the same time. Tea came through the Dutch; cocoa was
brought from South America to Spain, and coffee came from
Arabia by the way of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Coffee was for some time supplied only by Arabia, but near
the beginning of the eighteenth century its culture was introduced
into Java and the West India islands. At the present
day its culture is general within the tropics, Brazil leading the
list in amount annually produced. In the Eastern hemisphere
the principal coffee regions are Java and Ceylon, where a superior
article is produced. The amount of coffee imported into
the United States during the year ending June 30th, 1884, was
534,785,542 pounds, and 18,907,627 pounds in excess of the
previous year. It is seen that these figures give nearly ten
pounds for each individual in this vast country. This amount
per capita is exceeded by only a few countries. Holland leads
all European states, with an average of twenty-one pounds per
head, followed closely by Belgium, Denmark and Norway.</p>

<p>The dietetic value of coffee depends principally upon the
alkaloid caffeine or theine which it contains in common with
tea and cocoa or chocolate. Good coffee contains nearly one
per cent. of this substance. When obtained in a pure state it
crystallizes in slender needles. The peculiar aroma of coffee
is due to the presence of caffeone,<a href="#kitchen18" id="anch_kitchen18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which develops in the process
of roasting. It may be isolated as a brown oil, heavier
than water, by distilling roasted coffee with water. The roasting
of coffee is an operation requiring much good judgment,
for by carrying the process beyond a certain point the aroma
is destroyed and a disagreeable flavor is produced.</p>

<p>Roasted coffee when ground quickly deteriorates unless kept
in close vessels. Mocha coffee, which is brought from Arabia,
is the best, and that from Java ranks next. Much of the so-called
Mocha coffee is raised in Brazil, or elsewhere, and shipped
to Arabia, after which it finds its way into the markets.
The berries of the true Mocha coffee are small, dark and yellow;
those of Java are a paler yellow, while the West India
and Brazilian coffees have a greenish-gray tint. The last
named coffee is usually sold under the name of Rio, an abbreviation
of the leading coffee exporting port of Brazil,
namely, Rio de Janeiro; Martinique and St. Domingo coffees
are two other kinds but little known.</p>

<p>Coffee is principally valuable for its stimulating effects upon
the system. It produces a buoyancy of feeling, lightens the
sensation of fatigue, and sustains the muscles when under
prolonged exertion. A cup of rich, hot coffee seems to infuse
new life into an o’er-tired body. Equally with tea it is “the
cup that cheers, but not inebriates.”</p>

<p>Coffee is the subject of many adulterations, usually when
sold in the ground state. Several kinds of seeds resembling
coffee in size have been employed to adulterate the whole coffee,
some of which need to be colored before they will pass for
the genuine. Many kinds of roots are sliced, dried and
roasted for the adulteration of coffee, among the leading ones
of which are chicory, carrot and the beet. Spent tanbark and
even dried beef’s liver have been thus employed. Many of
these fraudulent additions can be detected with the microscope.
Ground coffee floats on water, while most of the adulterations
will sink or discolor the water. There is said to be a machine
in England for making false berries out of vegetable substance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate.</span>—The chocolate of the shops is derived from a
small evergreen tree, native of South America, Mexico, and
West Indias. This tree, <i>Theobroma cacao</i>, has large, pointed
leaves and rose-colored flowers, which are followed by fruit
pods six to ten inches long. The first part of the botanical
name is from the Greek meaning “food for the gods,” and the
second or specific word <i>cacao</i> is the old Mexican name for the
tree. The order Sterculiaceæ<a href="#kitchen19" id="anch_kitchen19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to which the theobroma or
chocolate tree belongs is not represented in our flora. It however
is known to many by a species of Mahernia<a href="#kitchen20" id="anch_kitchen20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> from the
cape of Good Hope, cultivated in conservatories. The order
contains about 520 species, nearly all of which are tropical.
The long pods, while green, resemble cucumbers, and when
ripe contain from thirty to an hundred seeds, arranged in rows,
and of the size of sweet almonds. During the season of ripening
the pods are gathered daily, laid in heaps until they have
fermented, when they are opened by hand and the seeds
spread in the sun to dry, after which they are ready for market.
Before the Spaniards visited Mexico the natives made
a beverage from the seeds, which they called <i>chocalat</i>, and
from this we derived our word chocolate. The Spaniards
have the credit of introducing this beverage into Europe. In
the manufacture of chocolate the <i>cocoa</i> (which is a corruption
of the original Mexican <i>cacao</i>) beans are roasted similar to the
roasting of coffee, and after the husk is removed they are reduced
to a paste. This paste is afterward mixed with equal
quantities of sugar and heated and turned into cakes of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
shapes familiar to all housekeepers. Cacao nibs are the
bruised and broken seeds, and cocoa shells are the thin coverings
of the seeds or beans which are separated before the
seeds are ground to powder. Broma is chocolate prepared for
the market in a certain way, and is a trade name.</p>

<p>The importations of chocolate for the year ending June 30th
were 12,235,304 pounds, being an increase of nearly thirty-five
per cent. over the previous year.</p>

<p>Of the three leading beverages herein briefly described tea
is the only one that has been grown as a crop in the United
States. In a reply to an inquiry recently addressed to the
Commissioner of Agriculture, it was stated that the tea plant
is hardy at Washington, D. C., and that the tea plantations
near Summerville, South Carolina, are doing well. “There is
no trouble about growing the plant, but the question of profitable
culture for the manufacture of tea is quite another thing.…
The purpose of the Department of Agriculture … is
to cheapen the present methods or possibly suggest the placing
of the teas on the market in a wholly different shape from
what is done at present.” We may be able to supply our own
demands for tea, but it is not likely that the same will be true
of coffee and chocolate.</p>

<h2 id="HOUSEHOLD_BEVERAGES">HOUSEHOLD BEVERAGES.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>At the breakfast table of a friend not long ago I heard the
gentleman of the house remark over his fragrant coffee:</p>

<p>“I laughed at my wife when she went into the cooking
school last summer, I thought her a model cook before; but
for some reason she has improved. I never tasted such coffee
as this.”</p>

<p>My hostess answered: “The reason is simple enough.
I had always cooked by rule before. I learned in my
studies in cookery to reason. It makes a great difference.”</p>

<p>It does make a difference, and never a greater than in preparing
tea, coffee and chocolate. There is rarely a cup of any
one of these beverages on our tables which is fit to drink; our
coffee is bitter and muddy, tea is either insipid or too strong,
and chocolate has failed to become the popular drink which it
deserves to be, because so rarely well prepared.</p>

<p>Few cooks understand the nature of either the coffee berry
or the tea leaf, and consequently do not know how to treat
them in order to extract their delicious flavor, aroma, and
nerve-bracing qualities.</p>

<p>Few cooks have an idea of the extreme delicacy of these articles,
of how scientifically, even artistically, they must be
treated. To extract an oil or flavor is one of the nicest experiments
of the laboratory, and one for which a chemist selects
his materials with the greatest care, attends strictly to the
cleanliness of his vessels, watches every change in temperature,
and counts even seconds in time. Making these beverages
is nothing less than performing a delicate chemical experiment,
and yet we are so ignorant or careless about this
important work that we attend strictly to neither heat nor time,
and often take just what we can most easily get to work with.</p>

<p>If you would have good tea, coffee and chocolate begin your
care with your buying. Tea is a most troublesome article to
purchase. There are so many varieties on the market, and so
much adulteration that the probability is that unless you are
taking extreme precautions you are getting an inferior article.
Adulteration is astonishingly common, poor teas being manipulated
to make them appear like the first-class grades; inferior
black teas colored to look like high-priced green teas, “lie
tea” sold in vast quantities, and made-over teas<a href="#bev1" id="anch_bev1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> made to pass
for fresh. How to obtain the genuine article is the housewife’s
first problem. Careful examination may be made under the
microscope for coloring matter, the tea may be soaked to see
if it unrolls into true leaves, or after washing it in a little water
the liquid may be tested with chemicals for foreign substances.
But all this means trouble that few housewives care to take.
Probably the most practical plan is to find by careful experiment
a thoroughly reliable<a href="#bev2" id="anch_bev2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> tea-house and then confine your
patronage to it. A pound of tea bought here and another
there, as convenience may dictate or some friend advise, will
insure you nothing but adulteration. The only safe plan is to
find a house which sells good tea. Your tea bought, it must be
prepared. In making a cup of tea the chemical composition
and the effect of each step in its preparation must be observed
or your draught will be ruined. The constituents in the leaf
which you must look after are the theine, the aromatic oil, and
the tannin. Your tea must be treated in such a way that the
first two, which give to the drink its flavor and aroma, will be
extracted, but that the bitter tannin will be left undeveloped.
The theine and oil are both volatile substances, so that if your
tea is steeped too long, or if it is boiled, they will literally fly
away, while the tannin extracted will turn your cup into a bitter,
herby drink. A rule is easily formulated from this bit of
science:</p>

<p>Into a perfectly clean tea-pot, just scalded with boiling hot
water, put a heaping tablespoonful of tea for each person, and
upon it pour a cup and a half of boiling water for each spoonful.
Cover your pot with a “cosy”<a href="#bev3" id="anch_bev3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> if you have one, and let
it stand on the back of the range, where it will not boil, for from
five to ten minutes. The length of time required to steep each
variety of tea must be determined by experiment, some varieties
taking longer than others. The exact length each housewife
must determine when she tries a new kind; and it may
be said of the exact proportion of tea to water that it as well
must be determined by experiment. No rule in cooking is inflexible.
It must always be modified by the good sense and
the scientific care of the cook.</p>

<p>The English custom of making tea on the table is the prettiest
and the most satisfactory. They pour upon the tea required a
small quantity of boiling water, this is placed upon the table,
covered with the “cosy;” a pot of water taken when boiling
from the stove is kept hot by a spirit lamp, and when the tea
is steeped as much boiling water as the quantity of tea used
demands is poured into the tea-pot. It is allowed to stand
about three minutes and then poured into the cups and on the
cream. Remember, cream should always be poured into the
cups first for both tea and coffee, and tea is as much improved
by cream as is coffee.</p>

<p>The purchase of coffee is beset with the same trouble as that
of tea—adulteration. You may get a manufactured berry, you
may get chiccory; to avoid this careful tests must be applied
and only reliable firms patronized. Nothing but unbrowned
coffee should be bought; the roasting should be done at home.
This process requires particular care. The coffee berry is
hard and horny, water has no effect upon it even when it has
been ground. It must be roasted in order that certain constituents
may become soluble. These constituents are a fragrant
volatile oil called caffeone, and the caffeine, which is
identical with the theine of tea. By roasting the oil is distributed
through the berry and so made soluble, while the caffeine
is developed so that it may be absorbed by water. Just the
right amount of roasting must be done or the essential constituents
will be expelled and the bitter qualities will be made to
predominate. I have said that the roasting should be done at
home. It may be done in the shops, of course, but the operation
there is carried on so unscientifically that the aroma is
lost on the town instead of being shut up in the berry. Only a
few days ago, passing up a business street of a city, I was astonished
to find the air heavy with the delicious aroma of
coffee. It scented the air for a square, and only when I came
to a large grocery store was the mystery explained. The grocer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was browning his coffee, and its odor was serving for an
advertisement, effective, perhaps, among the ignorant, but
which would warn every wise housewife not to purchase
roasted coffee. The process is best carried on in one of the
very nearly perfect coffee roasters to be found in the shops; if
these are not at hand an ordinary dripping pan may be used.
It should be covered to prevent loss of aroma, and should
be continually shaken to prevent burning. The entire
attention of one person should be given the coffee during
this operation. When turned to a rich chestnut brown remove,
keeping covered until quite cool. If left open the aroma escapes
very rapidly from warm coffee, but if kept covered much
of that made volatile by the heat is re-absorbed. A tight dish—an
air-tight canister is best—must be ready to keep it in.</p>

<p>When using, grind only what you need, and take care that
it is not left coarse, when the strength can not be extracted, or
that it is not too fine, when the liquor will be muddy in spite of
you; in this, as always, experiment until you know the degree
of fineness which ground coffee should have. A heaping
tablespoonful of ground coffee to a cup and a half of water is
the ordinary proportion for making strong coffee—the only
kind which should ever be prepared, by the way, the diluting
ought always to take place in the cup; to the required amount
of coffee add the white and shell of an egg and cold water to
thoroughly wet the whole; stir up these ingredients in your
coffee pot and pour upon them the required amount of <i>boiling</i>
hot water. Let it boil from ten to fifteen minutes, pour in half
a cup of cold water and remove to the side of the stove where
it can not boil. Do not boil longer than the exact time which
you have found necessary for the kind of coffee you are using,
if you do you lose your flavor and extract in its place a bitter
principle which is ruinous. Remember always what one of
our famous cooks says: “There comes a time in baking, frying
or broiling when injured nature revolts and burns up, but a
thing may boil until not a vestige of its original condition remains,
and unless the water evaporates, it may go on boiling
for hours without reminding one by smell or smoke that it is
spoiled.”</p>

<p>Your coffee will settle in about five minutes. Now if you
<i>must</i> use a different coffee urn, gently pour off the liquor so as
not to disturb the grounds. The settling of coffee is an essential
point. The regulation method of stirring an egg into the
freshly ground berry is undoubtedly best, but another and
more economical practice may take its place. After your
freshly roasted berries are cool enough to be easily handled,
add to each pound a fresh egg and stir it in until each kernel
is coated smoothly with the mixture. Care must be taken that
the coffee be not warm enough to cook the egg. When eggs
are expensive an economical method is to wash the shells before
they are broken, and use with cold water to settle the coffee.</p>

<p>After all these precautions there are still other points to
guard. Not the least is the condition of the inside of the coffee
pot; it should never be stained, burnt or coated, but kept perfectly
bright by being washed, and, if necessary, scoured after
each meal. It would be a gain in aroma if your coffee pot
could always be kept perfectly tight so that none could escape,
and if it could go to the table in the same dish. The pleasant,
suggestive odors which precede a meal are always signs
that the most delicious flavors of your coming breakfast, dinner
or tea are escaping, that through the unskillfulness of your
cook you are losing what should give the greatest charm to
your meal.</p>

<p><i>Café au lait</i><a href="#bev4" id="anch_bev4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is an excellent drink and easily prepared.
Make in the usual way a pint of strong coffee, and into your
table urn or a pitcher pour a cup and a half of fresh milk,
scalding hot; to this add the coffee and let the whole stand
for five minutes in a hot place, or in a kettle of hot water.</p>

<p>Chocolate is a most delicious drink if properly prepared; it is,
however, so often raw, muddy and strong that we have not been
able to educate ourselves to its peculiar disagreeableness.
Make it by the following rule and you will find it both nutritious
and pleasant: Select with care the best make of chocolate,
and into a little cold water rub smooth five tablespoonfuls
of grated chocolate; be sure that it be rubbed in
smoothly, a hard particle of chocolate is as unwelcome a
visitor in your cup as floating tea leaves or black bobbing bits
of coffee berries. So rub it smooth and stir it slowly into five
cups of boiling water. Let it boil for about five minutes, and
in the meantime heat two cups of milk; this must be stirred
into the boiling chocolate and the whole allowed to simmer
for a few minutes longer. You may sweeten it on the fire or
in the cup.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>All the time that we are awake we are learning by means of
our senses something about the world in which we live and of
which we form a part; we are constantly aware of feeling, or
hearing, or smelling, and, unless we happen to be in the dark,
of seeing; at intervals we taste. We call the information thus
obtained sensation.</p>

<p>When we have any of these sensations we commonly say
that we feel, or hear, or smell, or see, or taste something. A
certain scent makes us say we smell onions; a certain flavor,
that we taste apples; a certain sound, that we hear a carriage;
a certain appearance before our eyes, that we see a tree; and
we call that which we thus perceive by the aid of our senses a
thing or an object.</p>

<p>Moreover, we say of all these things, or objects, that they
are the causes of the sensations in question, and that the sensations
are the effects of these causes. For example, if we
hear a certain sound, we say it is caused by a carriage going
along the road, or that it is the effect, or the consequence, of a
carriage passing along. If there is a strong smell of burning,
we believe it to be the effect of something on fire, and look
about anxiously for the cause of the smell. If we see a tree,
we believe that there is a thing, or object, which is the cause
of that appearance in our field of view.</p>

<p>In the case of the smell of burning, when we find on looking
about, that something actually is on fire, we say indifferently
either that we have found out the cause of the smell, or that
we know the reason why we perceive that smell; or that we
have explained it. So that to know the reason why of anything,
or to explain it, is to know the cause of it. But that
which is the cause of one thing is the effect of another. Thus,
suppose we find some smouldering straw to be the cause of
the smell of burning, we immediately ask what set it on fire,
or what is the cause of its burning? Perhaps we find that a
lighted lucifer match has been thrown into the straw, and then
we say that the lighted match was the cause of the fire. But a
lucifer match would not be in that place unless some person
had put it there. That is to say, the presence of the lucifer
match is an effect produced by somebody as cause. So we ask,
why did any one put the match there? Was it done carelessly,
or did the person who put it there intend to do so? And
if so, what was his motive, or the cause which led him to do
such a thing? And what was the reason for his having such
a motive? It is plain that there is no end to the questions, one
arising out of the other, that might be asked in this fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we believe that everything is the effect of something
which preceded it as its cause, and that this cause is the effect
of something else, and so on, through a chain of causes and
effects which goes back as far as we choose to follow it. Anything
is said to be explained as soon as we have discovered its
cause, or the reason why it exists; the explanation is fuller, if
we can find out the cause of that cause; and the further we
can trace the chain of causes and effects, the more satisfactory
is the explanation. But no explanation of anything can be
complete, because human knowledge, at its best, goes but a
very little way back toward the beginning of things.</p>

<p>When a thing is found always to cause a particular effect,
we call that effect sometimes a property, sometimes a power of
the thing. Thus the odor of onions is said to be a property of
onions, because onions always cause that particular sensation
of smell to arise, when they are brought near the nose; lead is
said to have the property of heaviness, because it always
causes us to have the feeling of weight when we handle it; a
stream is said to have the power to turn a waterwheel, because
it causes the waterwheel to turn; and a venomous snake is
said to have the power to kill a man, because its bite may
cause a man to die. Properties and powers, then, are
certain effects caused by the things which are said to possess
them.</p>

<p>A great many of the things brought to our knowledge by our
senses, such as houses and furniture, carriages and machines,
are termed artificial things or objects, because they have been
shaped by the art of man; indeed, they are generally said to
be made by man. But a far greater number of things owe
nothing to the hand of man, and would be just what they are
if mankind did not exist—such as the sky and the clouds; the
sun, moon and stars; the sea with its rocks and shingly or
sandy shores; the hills and dales of the land; and all wild
plants and animals. Things of this kind are termed natural
objects, and to the whole of them we give the name of Nature.</p>

<p>Although this distinction between nature and art, between
natural and artificial things, is very easily made and very convenient,
it is needful to remember that, in the long run, we
owe everything to nature; that even those artificial objects
which we commonly say are made by men, are only natural
objects shaped and moved by men; and that, in the sense of
creating, that is to say, of causing something to exist which did
not exist in some other shape before, man can make nothing whatever.
Moreover, we must recollect that what men do in the way of
shaping and bringing together or separating natural objects,
is done in virtue of the powers which they themselves possess
as natural objects.</p>

<p>Artificial things are, in fact, all produced by the action of
that part of nature which we call mankind, upon the rest.</p>

<p>We talk of “making” a box, and rightly enough, if we mean
only that we have shaped the pieces of wood and nailed them
together; but the wood is a natural object and so is the iron of
the nails. A watch is “made” of the natural objects gold and
other metals, sand, soda, rubies, brought together, and shaped
in various ways; a coat is “made” of the natural object, wool;
and a frock of the natural objects, cotton or silk. Moreover,
the men who make all these things are natural objects.</p>

<p>Carpenters, builders, shoemakers, and all other artisans and
artists, are persons who have learned so much of the powers
and properties of certain natural objects, and of the chain of
causes and effects in nature, as enables them to shape and put
together those natural objects, so as to make them useful to
man.</p>

<p>A carpenter could not, as we say, “make” a chair unless he
knew something of the properties and powers of wood; a
blacksmith could not “make” a horseshoe unless he knew
that it is a property of iron to become soft and easily hammered
into shape when it is made red-hot; a brickmaker must
know many of the properties of clay; and a plumber could
not do his work unless he knew that lead has the properties
of softness and flexibility, and that a moderate heat causes
it to melt.</p>

<p>So that the practice of every art implies a certain knowledge
of natural causes and effects; and the improvement of the arts
depends upon our learning more and more of the properties
and powers of natural objects, and discovering how to turn the
properties and the powers of things and the connections of
cause and effect among them to our own advantage.</p>

<p>Among natural objects, as we have seen, there are some
that we can get hold of and turn to account. But all the greatest
things in nature and the links of cause and effect which
connect them, are utterly beyond our reach. The sun rises
and sets; the moon and the stars move through the sky; fine
weather and storms, cold and heat, alternate. The sea
changes from violent disturbance to glassy calm, as the winds
sweep over it with varying strength or die away; innumerable
plants and animals come in being and vanish again, without
our being able to exert the slightest influence on the majestic
procession of the series of great natural events. Hurricanes
ravage one spot; earthquakes destroy another; volcanic eruptions
lay waste a third. A fine season scatters wealth and
abundance here, and a long drought brings pestilence and
famine there. In all such cases, the direct influence of man
avails him nothing; and, so long as he is ignorant, he is the
mere sport of the greater powers of nature.</p>

<p>But the first thing that men learned, as soon as they began
to study nature carefully, was that some events take place in
regular order and that some causes always give rise to the
same effects. The sun always rises on one side and sets on
the other side of the sky; the changes of the moon follow one
another in the same order and with similar intervals; some
stars never sink below the horizon of the place in which we
live; the seasons are more or less regular; water always flows
down-hill; fire always burns; plants grow up from seed and
yield seed, from which like plants grow up again; animals are
born, grow, reach maturity, and die, age after age, in the same
way. Thus the notion of an order of nature and of a fixity in
the relation of cause and effect between things gradually entered
the minds of men. So far as such order prevailed it was
felt that things were explained; while the things that could
not be explained were said to have come about by chance, or
to happen by accident.</p>

<p>But the more carefully nature has been studied, the more
widely has order been found to prevail, while what seemed
disorder has proved to be nothing but complexity; until, at
present, no one is so foolish as to believe that anything happens
by chance, or that there are any real accidents, in the
sense of events which have no cause. And if we say that a
thing happens by chance, everybody admits that all we really
mean is, that we do not know its cause or the reason why that
particular thing happens. Chance and accident are only
<i>aliases</i><a href="#huxley1" id="anch_huxley1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of ignorance.</p>

<p>At this present moment, as I look out of my window, it is
raining and blowing hard, and the branches of the trees are
waving wildly to and fro. It may be that a man has taken
shelter under one of these trees; perhaps, if a stronger gust
than usual comes, a branch will break, fall upon the man, and
seriously hurt him. If that happens it will be called an “accident,”
and the man will perhaps say that by “chance” he
went out, and then “chanced” to take refuge under the tree,
and so the “accident” happened. But there is neither chance
nor accident in the matter. The storm is the effect of causes
operating upon the atmosphere, perhaps hundreds of miles
away; every vibration of a leaf is the consequence of the mechanical
force of the wind acting on the surface exposed to it;
if the bough breaks, it will do so in consequence of the relation
between its strength and the force of the wind; if it falls upon
the man it will do so in consequence of the action of other
definite natural causes; and the position of the man under it
is only the last term in a series of causes and effects, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
have followed one another in natural order, from that cause,
the effect of which was his setting out, to that the effect of which
was his stepping under the tree.</p>

<p>But, inasmuch as we are not wise enough to be able to unravel
all these long and complicated series of causes and
effects which lead to the falling of the branch upon the man,
we call such an event an accident.</p>

<p>When we have made out by careful and repeated observation
that something is always the cause of a certain effect, or
that certain events always take place in the same order, we
speak of the truth thus discovered as a law of nature. Thus
it is a law of nature that anything heavy falls to the ground if
it is unsupported; it is a law of nature that, under ordinary
conditions, lead is soft and heavy, while flint is hard and brittle;
because experience shows us that heavy things always do
fall if they are unsupported, that, under ordinary conditions,
lead is always soft, and that flint is always hard.</p>

<p>In fact, everything that we know about the powers and properties
of natural objects and about the order of nature may
properly be termed a law of nature. But it is desirable to remember
that which is very often forgotten, that the laws of
nature are not the causes of the order of nature, but only our
way of stating as much as we have made out of that order.
Stones do not fall to the ground in consequence of the law just
stated, as people sometimes carelessly say; but the law is the
way of asserting that which invariably happens when heavy
bodies at the surface of the earth, stones among the rest, are
free to move.</p>

<p>The laws of nature are, in fact, in this respect, similar to the
laws which men make for the guidance of their conduct toward
one another. There are laws about the payment of taxes, and
there are laws against stealing or murder. But the law is not
the cause of a man’s paying his taxes, nor is it the cause of his
abstaining from theft and murder. The law is simply a statement
of what will happen to a man if he does not pay his
taxes, and if he commits theft or murder; and the cause of his
paying his taxes, or abstaining from crime (in the absence of
any better motive) is the fear of consequences which is the
effect of his belief in that statement. A law of man tells what
we may expect society will do under certain circumstances;
and a law of nature tells us what we may expect natural objects
will do under certain circumstances. Each contains information
addressed to our intelligence, and except so far as it
Influences our intelligence, it is merely so much sound or
writing.</p>

<p>While there is this much analogy between human and natural
laws, however, certain essential differences between the
two must not be overlooked. Human law consists of commands
addressed to voluntary agents, which they may obey or
disobey; and the law is not rendered null and void by being
broken. Natural laws, on the other hand, are not commands,
but assertions respecting the invariable order of nature; and
they remain laws only so long as they can be shown to express
that order. To speak of the violation, or the suspension, of a
law of nature is an absurdity. All that the phrase can really
mean is that, under certain circumstances the assertion contained
in the law is not true; and the just conclusion is, not that the
order of nature is interrupted, but that we have made a mistake
in stating that order. A true natural law is a universal
rule, and, as such, admits of no exceptions.</p>

<p>Again, human laws have no meaning apart from the existence
of human society. Natural laws express the general
course of nature, of which human society forms only an insignificant
fraction.</p>

<p>If nothing happens by chance, but everything in nature follows
a definite order, and if the laws of nature embody that
which we have been able to learn about the order of nature in
accurate language, then it becomes very important for us to
know as many as we can of these laws of nature, in order that
we may guide our conduct by them.</p>

<p>Any man who should attempt to live in a country without
reference to the laws of that country would very soon find himself
in trouble. And if he were fined, imprisoned, or even
hanged, sensible people would probably consider that he had
earned his fate by his folly.</p>

<p>In like manner, any one who tries to live upon the face of
this earth without attention to the laws of nature will live there
for but a very short time, most of which will be passed in exceeding
discomfort; a peculiarity of natural laws, as distinguished
from those of human enactment, being that they take
effect without summons or prosecution. In fact, nobody could
live for half a day unless he attended to some of the laws of
nature; and thousands of us are dying daily, or living miserably,
because men have not yet been sufficiently zealous to
learn the code of nature.</p>

<p>It has already been seen that the practice of all our arts and
industries depends upon our knowing the properties of natural
objects which we can get hold of and put together; and though
we may be able to exert no direct control over the greater natural
objects and the general succession of causes and effects
in nature, yet, if we know the properties and powers of these
objects, and the customary order of events, we may elude that
which is injurious to us, and profit by that which is favorable.</p>

<p>Thus, though men can nowise alter the reasons or change
the process of growth in plants, yet having learned the order of
nature in these matters, they make arrangements for sowing
and reaping accordingly; they can not make the wind blow,
but when it does blow they take advantage of its known powers
and probable direction to sail ships and turn wind-mills; they
can not arrest the lightning, but they can make it harmless by
means of conductors, the construction of which implies a
knowledge of some of the laws of that electricity of which lightning
is one of the manifestations. Forewarned is forearmed,
says the proverb; and knowledge of the laws of nature is
forewarning of that which we may expect to happen, when we
have to deal with natural objects.</p>

<p>No line can be drawn between common knowledge of things
and scientific knowledge; nor between common reasoning and
scientific reasoning. In strictness all accurate knowledge is
science; and all exact reasoning is scientific reasoning. The
method of observation and experiment, by which such great
results are obtained in science, is identically the same as that
which is employed by every one, every day of his life, but refined
and rendered precise. If a child acquires a new toy, he
observes its characters and experiments upon its properties;
and we are all of us constantly making observations and experiments
upon one thing or another.</p>

<p>But those who have never tried to observe accurately will be
surprised to find how difficult a business it is. There is not
one person in a hundred who can describe the commonest occurrence
with even an approach to accuracy. That is to say,
either he will omit something which did occur, and which is of
importance, or he will imply or suggest the occurrence of
something which he did not actually observe, but which he
unconsciously infers must have happened. When two truthful
witnesses contradict one another in a court of justice, it usually
turns out that one or other, or sometimes both, are confounding
their inferences from what they saw with that which they
actually saw. A swears that B picked his pocket. It turns out
that all A really knows is that he felt a hand in his pocket
when B was close to him; and that B was not the thief, but C,
whom A did not observe. Untrained observers mix up together
their inferences from what they see with that which
they actually see in the most wonderful way; and even experienced
and careful observers are in constant danger of falling
into the same error.</p>

<p>Scientific observation is such as is at once full, precise, and
free from unconscious inference.</p>

<p>Experiment is the observation of that which happens when
we intentionally bring natural objects together, or separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
them, or in any way change the conditions under which they
are placed. Scientific experiment, therefore, is scientific observation,
performed under accurately known artificial conditions.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common observation that water sometimes
freezes. The observation becomes scientific when we ascertain
under what exact conditions the change of water into ice
takes place. The commonest experiments tell us that wood
floats in water. Scientific experiment shows that, in floating,
it displaces its own weight of the water.</p>

<p>Scientific reasoning differs from ordinary reasoning in just
the same way as scientific observation and experiment differ
from ordinary observation and experiment—that is to say, it
strives to be accurate; and it is just as hard to reason accurately
as it is to observe accurately.</p>

<p>In scientific reasoning general rules are collected from the
observation of many particular cases; and, when these general
rules are established, conclusions are deduced from them, just
as in everyday life. If a boy says that “marbles are hard,” he
has drawn a conclusion as to marbles in general from the marbles
he happens to have seen and felt, and has reasoned in
that mode which is technically termed induction. If he declines
to try to break a marble with his teeth, it is because he
consciously or unconsciously performs the converse operation
of deduction from the general rule “marbles are too hard to
break with one’s teeth.”</p>

<p>You will learn more about the process of reasoning when
you study logic, which treats of that subject in full. At present,
it is sufficient to know that the laws of nature are the general
rules respecting the behavior of natural objects, which
have been collected from innumerable observations and experiments;
or, in other words, that they are inductions from
those observations and experiments. The practical and theoretical
results of science are the products of deductive reasoning
from these general rules.</p>

<p>Thus science and common sense are not opposed, as people
sometimes fancy them to be, but science is perfected common
sense. Scientific reasoning is simply very careful common
reasoning, and common knowledge grows into scientific knowledge
as it becomes more and more exact and complete.</p>

<p>The way to science then lies through common knowledge;
we must extend that knowledge by common observation and
experiment, and learn how to state the results of our investigations
accurately, in general rules or laws of nature; finally,
we must learn how to reason accurately from these rules, and
thus arrive at rational explanations of natural phenomena,
which may suffice for our guidance in life.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CIRCLE_OF_THE_SCIENCES">THE CIRCLE OF THE SCIENCES.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Science means classified knowledge. There may be much
general knowledge that is not science. It attains to that dignity
only when the particular facts known are generalized, and
arranged in some order, instead of being jumbled together,
and lying about loosely in the memory, to be taken up at random.
Especially must the basal facts of the science be verified,
not assumed.</p>

<p>Information that is general and assured, though as yet lacking
system and a proper ordering of the elementary facts,
may, and usually will in time advance to the dignity of science.
History warrants this expectation. Only let not the
boast be made, or the honor conferred prematurely. Geography,
chemistry, and political economy are all now sciences.
The first has been recognized among the sciences from an
early day, though it has advanced rapidly during the present
century. The last two are comparatively new members, having
held their place in the “Circle” scarcely a hundred years.
True, many of the facts of chemistry, and the principles of
political economy had been known for ages, but the knowledge
men had of them lacked either system or certainty, or both.
So, also, in respect to mineralogy, botany, and zoölogy, a store
of known facts had been for ages accumulating, before they
could rightly be called sciences. To reach that distinction the
quality and orderly arrangement of the things known are as
necessary as the quantity.</p>

<p>In the heading of this series of articles, “Circle” does not
suggest the rim of a wheel, or a curved line all the points of
which are equally distant from the center around which it is
drawn, but rather a group of sciences, just as “social circle,”
and “circle of friends” indicate the amicable relations of the
persons without saying anything of their positions in the place
of their meeting. It is a goodly group, this family of the sciences,
and the members now so numerous and having such distinctive
characteristics will be introduced, not as a body but severally,
and in five classes: The Mathematical, Physical, Mental,
Moral, and Social Sciences. They hold such intimate relations
with each other, mutually giving and receiving aid,
that we will not attempt to keep the members of classes from
mixing occasionally in our account of them, as they often do
in reality.</p>

<p>Mathematics is the science of quantities and numbers. Its principles
are of the first importance, and are of service in all the
departments of science. In several of its subdivisions, of which
brief mention will be made, it uses known quantities for the
determination of those unknown, reasoning from certain relations
existing between them. The qualities it discusses are
represented by diagrams, figures, or symbols, adopted for the
purpose. It is customary to speak of <i>pure</i> and <i>mixed</i>, or <i>abstract</i>
and <i>applied</i> mathematics; the former treating of laws,
principles, and relations in the abstract, or without any special
reference to anything as actual or existing. The latter discusses
the principles, laws and relations in connection with existing
phenomena. The operations with numbers and symbols
in pure mathematics, dealing only with abstract quantities, do
not necessarily imply the idea of matter. Those of the science
as applied have much to do with material phenomena.
The elements that enter into the calculations in both cases are
axioms or self-evident truths, things that are known intuitively,
or grasped by the reason soon as presented, only in applied
mathematics, used more or less in all sciences, these same axiomatic,
self-evident truths are employed in the discussion of
natural objects, the laws, properties, and relations of which are
learned mostly by experience and induction.</p>

<p>The sciences classed as pure mathematics are Arithmetic,
Geometry, Algebra, Analytical Geometry and Calculus. Arithmetic
is eminently the science of numbers, and treats of, or
practically illustrates their nature and uses. It employs the
nine Arabic digits or figures with the addition of the cipher,
giving them various positions to express numerical
values, and not the native qualities or functions of the things
to which they are applied. The methods are the same, and
the results obtained equally true, whatever may be the nature
of the quantities about which inquiry is made. The elementary
or fundamental idea in arithmetic is unity, expressed by
the figure 1, from which, with the help of the other eight digits,
and the individually valueless cipher, 0, expressions for all the
other values, whole or fractional, are formed.</p>

<p>As arithmetical processes underlie, or enter into, the work of
nearly all mathematical calculations, its great importance as
a science is evident; though as often taught in our schools and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
used in business, it is simply a method of reckoning or computation.</p>

<p>Algebra is a kindred science, that, by the use of letters and
symbols, enables us to solve more readily all difficult questions
relating to numbers. It is, indeed, a kind of universal
arithmetic. In the ordinary arithmetic the numbers or figures
employed, taken separately, have always the same value, and the
result, when, sometimes by a tedious process, obtained, is applicable
only to the particular question proposed, but in solving
the problem by algebra, since we employ letters to which
any values may be attributed at pleasure, the result obtained
is largely applicable to all questions of a particular class.
Thus, having the sum and difference of two quantities given,
we readily obtain an algebraic expression for the quantities
themselves. By the new method the goal is reached speedily,
and the cabalistic terms, that may, at his first attempts, perplex
and discourage the young student, become his delight;
and in many difficult processes greatly shorten the work, enabling
him with ease to solve problems that to the common
arithmetician are tedious, if not impossible.</p>

<p>Geometry, one of the oldest of sciences, measures extension,
treats of order and proportion in space. Its working
elements are not numbers or symbols, but points, and lines,
either straight or curved, and surfaces, with volumes, or solids.
The simpler problems, when successfully demonstrated, are
used in solving those more complicated, making the progress
easy.</p>

<p>Lines are made up of points, and have extension only in one
direction. Surfaces have length and breadth, and are distinguished
as triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, etc., according to
the number of lines that circumscribe them. Solids have length,
breadth, and thickness. From a few elementary facts, much geometrical
science has been deduced, by very simple, logical processes.
It is intimately related to other sciences, and of much
practical importance; but, if there were no other advantage derived,
as a discipline of the reasoning faculty there can be
nothing better. To pursue the study profitably there is little
need of an instructor. Class recitations are helpful, but let
any one intent on personal culture, and having only a little
time for the work, get a good elementary treatise on plane and
solid geometry, and study it. The exercise will become a delight,
will give strength and grip to the faculties, and furnish
protection against the mental dissipation caused by spending
much time in the hasty, careless reading of what is fitly called
light literature.</p>

<p>Analytical geometry is that branch which examines, discusses
and develops the properties of geometrical magnitudes
by the use of algebraic symbols. The questions or problems
are solved, not, as in plane geometry, by diagrams or
figures drawn to show certain relations of magnitudes, but by
making algebraic symbols represent them, and thus solving
the problems. Analysis is much used in simple algebraic processes,
but more in analytical geometry, and in differential and
integral calculus, which has been called the transcendental analysis.
It is useful as a higher branch of the science, and without
it the best achievements of the greatest mathematicians
would scarcely have been possible. These last named branches
are generally best pursued in our higher academies and
colleges. A college course would be sadly deficient without
them, but only for exceptional cases would it be advisable to
put them in a course of study to be pursued privately.</p>

<p>If this brief mention of the higher mathematics kindles desire
for further knowledge, and you hesitate to grapple with
them alone, by all means go to college, and after a proper introduction,
wherein the chief embarrassment is felt, even calculus
will be found an agreeable acquaintance.</p>

<p>Under the head of “Mixed Mathematics,” applicable to both
laws or abstract principles and facts, the discussion of things as
actual and possible, we have first, mechanics, the science that
treats of the various forces and their different effects. By <i>force</i>
is meant any power that tends to prevent, produce, or modify
motion. Three are recognized—(1) gravitation, or the attraction
of bodies toward each other; (2) the cause, whatever it may
be, of light, heat, and electricity; (3) life, an equally mysterious
power producing the actions of animals and the growth of
plants. These forces, though entirely unseen and their causes
unknown, are definite quantities. We readily conceive of one
force as equal to, or greater than another, and know that equal
forces, applied in opposite directions, balance each other. To
everything that moves there is force applied greater than the
resistance to be overcome. A number of forces may act on
an object at the same time, accelerating, retarding, or changing
the direction of the motion given to it. When the forces
are so balanced as to hold the body on which they act in a
state of equilibrium, their action and consequent phenomena
are investigated under the head of <span class="smcap">Statics</span>, or the science
which treats of bodies at rest. When motion is produced, <span class="smcap">Dynamics</span>
considers the laws that govern the moving bodies and
the phenomena that result. These branches of mechanical
science are of great practical importance, and a knowledge of
them would save from many blunders and failures resulting
from incompetence. The same laws govern in the movement
of all bodies, whether solid or liquid. Hydrostatics, Hydrodynamics,
Hydraulics, etc., are branches of the same science,
and worthy of separate mention only because they apply the
general principles of statics and dynamics to the phenomena
of rest or motion in liquids. The foundation for all that is peculiar
in these branches with the lengthened names, and that
together may be called Hydro-mechanics, lies in the properties
that distinguish the liquid from other states of material bodies,
whether gaseous or solid, viz.: in the presence of cohesion,
but with great mobility of parts and more or less elasticity.
Some peculiarities are so noteworthy as to deserve mention
even in this limited presentation. Because of the only slight
cohesive attraction, and entire freedom of motion among the
particles, liquid bodies possess no definite form of their own,
but adapt themselves to the form of the excavations or vessels
containing them. They, of course, vary much in their fluidity,
the mobile liquids, as water and alcohol, flowing more readily
than molasses, heavy oils, and tar. Fluids at rest press
equally in all directions, upward, downward, and laterally. In
this, also, they differ from solids that press only down, or in
the direction of the center of gravitation. If not confined
they can not be heaped up, but their particles seek a common
level. An absolute water level is, of course, possible only
when the area covered is so limited that lines joining all the
points on the surface with the center of gravity are practically
parallel, or their convergence an inappreciable quantity. In
large bodies of water, as the ocean, the surface corresponds
with the general rotundity of the earth.</p>

<p>The fact of the equal pressure of liquids in all directions,
and with the same intensity, is found of great importance in
practical mechanics. The strong pressure of a small column
of water is finely illustrated by simple experiment with the
water bellows, or hydraulic paradox, in which one pound of
water in a tube lifts a hundred pounds on the top of the bellows,
and the greater the disproportion between the diameter
of the tube and that of the top of the bellows, the greater
weight it will raise. More than two hundred years ago Pascal
showed the enormous pressure exerted by a lofty column of
water in a small tube. A strong cask was filled with water,
and a small tube forty feet high closely fitted in its head, when
a few pints of water poured into it burst the cask, and would
have done so if it had been made of the strongest oaken staves
and bound with hoops of iron. This is the power used in the
hydraulic press, a very simple machine of much value in the
industrial arts when there is a demand for great force that can
be slowly and steadily applied, as in compressing cloth, oil
cake, paper, gunpowder and numerous other things. Its parts
are so few that it can be described without a model to represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
it. A small, upright cylinder, with a closely fitting piston
used as a pump to draw and force the water, and connected at
the base by a tube with a much larger cylinder directly under
the substance to be pressed, in which there is also a piston to be
moved upward, though water tight. The whole is secured in
position by powerful frame work. Beneath the piston the water
is received. And knowing the principles of hydrostatics we can
estimate its power. If the areas of the lower surfaces of the
two pistons are to each other as one to four hundred square
inches, one pound pressure on the small one will deliver to
the lower surface of the large one a pressure equal to four
hundred pounds weight. But let the arms of the lever used as
the force pump handle be to each other as one to fifty. Then
when a force of fifty pounds is applied at the end of the long
arm of the lever it will descend with a force of 50×50=2,500,
and there will be delivered on the lower surface of the
large piston a power to raise it expressed by 50×50×400=1,000,000.
Some allowance must be made for friction or other
impediments, say one fourth, which is more than enough, and
still a man or boy at the end of that pump handle would be
able to lift at least three hundred and seventy-five tons.</p>

<p>The sciences we have been considering under the general
name of mechanics, which is derived from a Greek word that
means to contrive, invent, construct, have much to do with
machinery, with the methods of construction, the propelling
forces, and the phenomena produced. There were machinists
and some simple machines propelled by human or brute force,
by weights and springs, by falling or running water, and air in
motion before the laws of motion and forces were understood,
or the rude mechanic arts began to assume the character of a
science. The machines were, of course, imperfect, and lacked
efficiency, while many of those now in use seem nearly perfect
and adapted to the work expected of them. But notwithstanding
the marvelous advance that has been made in the
manufacture of machinery, and the intelligent application of
mechanical powers, we look for still greater things as possible
in the future.</p>

<p>It is well, however, never to forget that whatever the seeming
may be, the most perfect machine of human invention does
not create force. That is as impossible for man as it is to give
life or create matter. All he can do is to collect, concentrate
and use, to the best advantage, the forces that exist. He may
by skillful appliances gain a great mechanic advantage, and
overcome very formidable resistance, but he must be content
to do it very slowly; and it has been often said that “what he
gains in power he loses in speed.” In many cases this seems
a necessity, and he must submit to it. His simplest machine,
if the fulcrum is placed very near the weight, gives a man tremendous
power gained by his position at the long arm of the
machine. But the point at which he applies the force must
move much faster and a greater distance than the object
against which it is directed. So when a man with a system of
pulleys raises to the top of a tower a block of granite that four
men might lift from the ground he sacrifices in speed what he
gains in the new way of applying the force he has for the purpose.</p>

<p>You visit a large manufacturing establishment or the mechanical
department of a great national or international industrial
exposition and see a whole acre of machinery of all
kinds, shafts, wheels, saws, lathes, and spindles in rapid motion,
and, astonished at the complications, inquire for the
power that carries the whole. You will possibly find it is in
some remote part of the premises, and shut up in the motionless
boiler where the steam is said to be generated, which only
means that the water heated expands and struggles to escape
from its confinement, while man understanding the laws of its
action manages to liberate the force under conditions that
make it his servant.</p>

<p>The science of numbers and magnitudes, useful in discussing
the distances, measurements, and motions of terrestrial
bodies, is especially so in its application to astronomy.</p>

<p>Astronomy as a physical science will receive consideration in
the next number; here only the mathematical elements are noticed,
and they are everywhere manifest. The same general laws
control all material bodies, those near to us, and those seen at
a distance. So the science of the stars is not now mere theory,
but has all the elements of mathematical certainty. When
dealing with such vast numbers and magnitudes as engage the
astronomer’s attention, with a few known principles or laws,
and abundant recorded telescopic observations for the basis of
their work, men can calculate even more accurately than they
can count or measure. Having once prepared their theorem,
aided by the logarithms of Napier<a href="#circle1" id="anch_circle1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that simplify and shorten
the more difficult arithmetical calculations, they can readily
determine the distance, magnitude and motions of a planet,
and know that it is done with sufficient exactness. The distances
of the heavenly bodies are generally determined by
their parallax, that is the difference between the directions of
the bodies as seen from two different points. The inclination
of the lines thus drawn is the angle of parallax. By supposing
the lines prolonged to the sun, and other lines drawn
through the points selected to the center of the earth a quadrangle
is formed, all the angles and sides of which are easily
found. In measuring very minute parallaxes it may not be
possible to determine the exact position of the body as projected
on the celestial sphere, but in that case recourse can be
had to relative parallax, or the difference between the parallaxes
of two bodies lying nearly in the same direction. The
best opportunity for this is afforded by the transit of Venus,
and on this account great interest is felt in that phenomenon,
and extensive preparations are made for taking accurate observations.</p>

<p>The figure, size and density of the celestial bodies have all
been calculated with approximate certainty. The orbits,
through which they pass in their revolutions, described, and
their velocities ascertained.</p>

<p>There is a solar system of which the sun is the center, and
in its relation to the planets stationary, though really moving
on through infinite space; the orbits through which planets
move are not circles, but more or less elliptic, having the sun
at one focus of the ellipse.</p>

<p>That planets move in ellipses was announced by Kepler<a href="#circle2" id="anch_circle2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as
the first law governing their motions, and a second deduced
from this and confirmed by observations, is that they do not
move with equal velocity in all parts of their orbits; and that
<i>a line drawn from the center of the earth to the center of the
sun passes over equal spaces in equal times</i>. He also found as
a third law that <i>the squares of the times of the revolutions of
the planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances
from the sun</i>.</p>

<p>Navigation shows how vessels are directed in their course
upon the great waters. In proportion as the “paths of the
seas” have become open, safe and free for all, they are found
paths of knowledge and civilization. The science, small at its
beginning, has grown to its present advanced state by slow degrees,
helped by contributions from the most opposite sources.
Practical but uneducated seamen have doubtless done much,
as their ingenuity is often, in emergencies, taxed to supply
means of safety and success that are wanting. More has been
contributed by scholars, secluded philosophic men whose lives
are spent “in communion with the skies,” in observing the
motions of the heavenly bodies and studying the laws by
which they are regulated. But perhaps the most valuable service
has been rendered by another class who combine an experience
of the sea with much knowledge of astronomical
science, men acquainted with the needs of seamen and qualified
to meet them. The introduction of the mariner’s compass
early in the fifteenth century was an epoch in the history of
navigation, as it made seamen in a measure independent of
the sun and stars. This was an incalculable advantage, as
soon became apparent to those who adopted the compass as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
their guide. Of the many improvements and helps in the
science of navigation we can only name, as conspicuous, the
invention of Mercator’s chart<a href="#circle3" id="anch_circle3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in 1569, Davis’s quadrant<a href="#circle4" id="anch_circle4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
about 1600, and Hadley’s quadrant a century later. The character
of the instruments and a glance at the Nautical Almanac
will show how largely both mathematics and astronomy enter
into the science of navigation. Nor is it quite safe to take
passage with a shipmaster who has but limited knowledge of
either. He should at least thoroughly understand his instruments
and be a ready, accurate computer.</p>

<p>Geometry grew out of the practice of surveying, and now
embodies many of the laws and principles of the science.
There are several distinct systems of surveying, classed according
to the purposes contemplated. It is astronomically employed
in determining the figure of the earth by the actual
measurement of arcs. A fair knowledge of mathematics and
trigonometry is required in what are known as coast surveys.
Land surveying is of the plainest kind, and employed in finding
the contents of areas, or in dividing large tracts into lots
of smaller dimensions. The chief difficulty is in getting the
exact bearing of the lines and the measure of the angles when
the plot is an irregular polygon.</p>

<p>Topographical surveying, beside the measurement of lines
and angles, takes note of variations of level, that the draft may
properly represent superficial inequalities. Maritime surveying
is an important branch, fixing the positions of shoals,
rocks and shore-lines. Mine surveying determines the location
of works in the mine and decides whether the excavations
conform, as required, to lines on the surface. The compass
and chain are the surveyor’s most common instruments, but
others are used according to the nature of the surveys to be
made. Incompetency or carelessness in surveys often occasions
serious trouble and loss.</p>

<p>Fortifications for the defense of cities and the protection of
soldiers are as ancient as the existence of armies. The former,
built in time of peace, of such form and materials as military
science and experience suggest, are called “permanent fortifications;”
and the temporary works constructed as the exigencies
of a campaign require are “field fortifications.” The art
and science have been practiced and studied in all ages, and
there is now an immense literature on the subject.</p>

<p>As methods of defense must be adjusted to those of attack
the earlier permanent fortifications, in the progress of society
and after the introduction of artillery, became nearly worthless.
High stone walls are a protection while they stand, but,
however strong, they can be battered down by heavy siege
guns that have less effect when directed against earth works,
which seem less formidable. A place thoroughly fortified is
seldom taken by a sudden assault. The United States have
fortified less than most of the great European nations, but are
by no means defenseless. Previous to 1860 there had been
expended on our forts more than $30,000,000; and all the exposed
positions have been greatly strengthened within the
last twenty-five years.</p>

<p>The room which above all others should be furnished with
the most loving thought and lavish expense is the household
parlor, or family sitting room. Here the father reads his evening
paper, the mother busies herself with her ready needle, the
children “with books, or work or healthful play.” This
should be to eye and body preëminently a restful room, commodious,
cheerful. If the reception room for visitors needs
the cheer of firelight, how much more the <i>living room</i> of the
household.</p>

England farm house remains unexcelled in the literature of
house furnishing:</p>

<p>For the sake of restfulness to the eye, the walls and carpet
should be neutral in tone, making a good background to the
family figures; the wall paper being of a good all-overish pattern
that will not detract from pictures that may hang on it,
and the carpet or rug well mixed, of not too loud a pattern,
and without strong contrasts of light and dark. Blue wall papers
are hard to deal with, but creams, fawns, soft greenish
or olive-grays, and simple leaf patterns with slight variations
of color or shade are all good for walls that are to be hung
with pictures, as a sitting room should be. Common butchers’
paper, put on in sheets, the better textured cartridge paper, or
sheathing paper with a pretty variation introduced by way of
frieze or dado are all restful to the eye and good for the sitting
room walls. The greens used should not be sharp and crude,
but should be modified, making them yellowish, bluish, or
grayish. So with reds, which will be better yellowish, slightly
bluish (not purplish), or brownish; and yellows which must
be modified into creams, old-golds, or fawns. This rule is for
large surfaces. A little pure, bright color can be introduced
here and there by way of decoration, and must appear somewhere
in the room if it is to have a cheerful look, but wait till
your pictures are hung before you introduce much brilliant
color. It may take the life out of them. Picture-rods are a
great convenience, and, after the first expense, save much
trouble, and much marring of walls by driving nails. The
picture-rod should run below the frieze, and a box of picture-hooks
of suitable size for the rods should be kept ready to
hand, and picture-wire so that a new painting or engraving
when it comes home may find its place at once and not stand
on the floor for a month waiting till the master can drive a
nail. As for the wall decorations, there should be a looking-glass
for family convenience either in this parlor or the entry
way (the parlor is the better place), and the best pictures the
house affords, always making sure that they are good pictures.
Better always a good photograph, or wood-cut, or etching, than
a poor chromo, steel engraving, or water-color; and better, a
hundred fold, a good water-color than a poor oil painting. If
your family portraits are poor, consign them to the garret or
the upstairs hall, but, if possible, have at least one good painting
in your home-room, even if it does cost money; and remember
that a first-hand sketch by a good living artist is better
than a second-hand copy of an old master. But one good
painting in a house, whether a copy or an original, is a continual
art lesson. A woman of taste will not mix all manner
of pictures together on one wall. If possible, she will keep
oil paintings by themselves, and not put them in juxtaposition
with water-colors—nor will she put a picture suited only to a
gallery in a family sitting room. Nor will she put Bacchantes
in the same group with worshiping cherubs. There is a vast
deal of stuff purely ephemeral that women are apt to load their
walls with—Christmas, New Year, Easter and birthday cards,
and painted panels, which may do very well to exhibit during
the holidays or the day or two after the birthday; then, having
had their day, they should cease to obtrude if not to be. There
should be a box or receptacle for all this clutter; such souvenirs
are admirable for their suggestions to the amateur decorator
or embroiderer of the family, but they should not be
allowed to spot the walls, to hang from the side brackets or to
decorate the looking-glass. “God bless our home” is a devout
aspiration which is better carried out in a godly life than
worked in cross-stitch and hung over the sitting room door.
I have seen Scripture texts deftly inwrought into the mural
decoration of a sea-side cottage, verses from the sailors’
Psalm being painted in a decorative way between border lines
of frieze or dado, where they did not seem out of place, but the
summer boarders were well nigh driven from another cottage
because of a card-board abomination hung over the mantel
piece of their sitting room, with indigo clouds and grass-green
waves, with a three-quarters-length Christ in all colors of the
rainbow uttering the magic words worked in shaded reds—“Peace,
Be Still.” The matter of mottoes has been overdone,
and it is always safe to leave them out altogether.</p>

<p>Paintings upon plush must be exceedingly good to make
them worth hanging anywhere. Usually such decoration is a
waste of expensive material. Any way, plush is too easily
spoiled by dust or careless handling to make it welcome in the
family room. Painting upon picture and looking-glass frames
is another misuse of decoration. A London artist with rare
ingenuity paints a stalk of lilies to hide a flaw in his hall mirror,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and straightway the “Decorative Art” salesrooms all
over our land effloresce with blooming mirror frames whose
unpruned vines straggle and trail over every glass. The
beauty of a mirror is to have it absolutely clear and free from
dust and dirt, finger marks or paint blotches, throughout its
entire surface. Flower painting in polychrome upon frames
and easels is utterly out of place, as it calls the eye off from the
picture which the frame or easel holds, and reminds one of a
servant decked out in finery surreptitiously borrowed from her
mistress’s wardrobe.</p>

<p>Marble mantel pieces, to be good, must be expensive. A
simple pine mantel piece with a little incised ornament is far
better than white or cold gray marble. Raised, stuck-on ornament
is objectionable, whether in wood or stone, but mantel
pieces, book-cases and cabinets give a fine opportunity for
domestic carving, and one can but wonder that more home
ingenuity is not expended on the construction and carving of
mantels and other woodwork in our rooms, such as doors and
windows. I have seen a wooden mantel piece small, plain,
and somewhat cheap and inferior-looking, so improved by a
little carving, judiciously introduced by the man of the house—a
small panel set in here, and the edge of the shelf prettily
finished—that the whole thing grew dignified at once and became
a worthy ornament of the “spare room,” when painted in
harmony with the rest of the woodwork. The youngest whittlers
might be taught to use tools for the family good, if parents
were only willing to go to a little trouble and expense in providing
models, tools and wood for their use, and a comfortable
chimney nook where the work could be carried on. In the
schools of Philadelphia Mr. Leland has shown how much may be
done by boys and girls when their efforts are wisely directed.</p>

<p>When there is no room in the house specially set apart as a
library, cabinets and book cases form an important part of the
sitting room furniture. I would have book shelves of some
sort in every room of a house; but in the room where the
family gathers there should be a special shelf for books of reference.
An encyclopædia is of as much value to the household
as a wood lot is to the farm. Better wear your old silk
gown or shabby overcoat another year, or two years even, and
have your book of reference always at hand for the general
good. The unabridged dictionary is a necessity, and should
stand in its rack easy of access to school children and their
elders as well. A household book of poetry, Dana’s or Bryant’s,
or whatever may be better, and an equally comprehensive
volume of religious verse like Gilman’s, or Palgrave’s
choice “Golden Treasury,” should be well thumbed by the
children, and should be placed temptingly at hand, not locked
behind glass doors. Glazed doors are demanded by collectors
who revel in vellum, uncut leaves, and rare editions, but cases
that are well backed and that have leathern, or even moreen
or flannel, valences tacked to the shelves, will serve well
enough to protect books in a house where all the reading matter
is for daily use or study.</p>

<p>A low book case three or four feet high and broad enough
to fill a generous wall space, running, if need be, across one
side of the room, may be found ample enough for a family
whose library is limited. Pictures and vases can be ranged
upon its top. I know a room that holds three or four such
book cases of ebonized pine, filled with books and made gay
with valences of scarlet moreen, which yet scorns to be called
“the library,” and is only known as the family “sitting
room.” Valences of leather or wool are sufficient to protect
the books from dust if the cases are well backed.</p>

<p>In addition to the book case, hanging shelves for children’s
books, or cabinets for collections of any sort, can be made of
pine, and when absolutely plain, if neatly varnished, need not
prove unsightly. They may even be made very ornamental
by a bright curtain, plain or embroidered, with rings attached
that run lightly over a brass rod or wire, and screen the contents
of the shelves from the too inquisitive eye.</p>

<p>It is really a happy day for a household when one of its
members develops a hobby and begins to make a collection—not
of buttons or business cards, but of something on which
genuine study will not come amiss, and there is hardly any
line in which one is likely to interest himself where he may
not often pick up for a mere trifle much that will be of special
value to his collection, much that, by itself, would be comparatively
worthless, but which in a collection has added worth
and dignity; and any collection makes a new point of interest
in a home. In a quiet country town where I once lived, the
boys of the village took to collecting butterflies and insects.
Farmers carried turpentine or benzine in their pockets, and
would come home from their haying fields with hats gay with
the captured moths and butterflies they were taking to the
collectors of their several households. Thus homes hitherto
utterly wanting in any æsthetic influence, seemed to brighten
into something positively charming, when father and mother,
son and daughter clustered about the drawers in the front parlor,
exhibiting to any chance visitor the fragile treasures so
carefully arranged within them, and when a new specimen was
captured the collector would</p>

<div class="verse">And look and look again, as he would look it through.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Think of the many lines in which the collector may work!
The postage stamp craze was by no means to be despised; it
was a good geography lesson for the children, and well up to
the times, throwing in a little history as well. Coin collecting is
yet more profitable in the same lines, and when confined to the
coins of one’s own land, gives a wide enough range for the
average collector. For the out-of-door student there are shells,
sea mosses and birds’ eggs, flowers to press, and minerals to
secure. One boy hunts up Indian relics, another collects
weapons of various sorts, from</p>

<p class="unindent">to an Australian boomerang or a South Sea Island club brought by
the sailor uncle from some voyage of long ago. One dear, old
lady has a choice collection of bits of lace all dated and
named; another of pieces of brocade, an admirable commentary
on silk manufactory. Here we find a treasurer of fans,
and there of snuff-boxes; here of children’s photographs, and
there of photographs or autographs of famous men; and everywhere,
all over our land, will be found the covetous collector
of rare, old china and pottery. Let the children be encouraged
to interest themselves in some such lines as these, not
so as to make nuisances of themselves and museums of their
homes—there will be little danger of that—but enough to give
them a wholesome enthusiasm in some particular line of study.
A vast deal of general information is disseminated through a
household, unconsciously absorbed, as it were, when each one
has a hobby of his own, and gives out of his choicest discoveries
for the common good.</p>

<p>As to the sitting room furniture, there are a few essentials
that must be emphasized. There should be a table large
enough for half a dozen people to sit around of an evening—a
round one is best—strong, solid, and covered with a serviceable
cloth. There are handsome woolen table covers that grow
yet handsomer with age as their colors mellow together, but
the best is expensive. A square of plain felt does very well, and
is in better taste than the scarlet and green felt cloths stamped
with black figures that were so prevalent twenty years ago. A
figured cloth shows spots less than a plain one. If a mat
of some sort, or even a newspaper, is always laid down under
any lamp that burns kerosene, and if a blotter is always used
where writing or painting is going on, a plain cloth ought to
last for years. Light should abound where the family sit together,
sunlight by day and good gas or lamp light by night
should be generously supplied. A good duplex burner or a
double student lamp uses no more oil than several small lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
dotted down here and there, about the room, and it brings the
family together about the central table. So with the drop light,
which is an essential where gas is used. The wise woman discards
gas in her sitting room, however, and uses good oil,
which is far better for the eyes. There should be a writing
desk in the room. The old-fashioned secretary was a valuable
piece of sitting room furniture, and many a good one has been
recalled from the attic within the last few years, and, by a
judicious use of soda water, has been freed from old paint, and
when scrubbed and rubbed, it has shone as good as new, and
much more useful than the modern Davenport. There should
be large, easy chairs, not too low, for the use of the men of the
house, and for elderly people who find it hard to rise gracefully
and with ease from soft, low chairs. There should also
be low chairs with broad seats, and short arms, or none at all,
for those who must busy themselves with sewing, knitting, and
embroidery, and comfortable camp chairs that can be lightly
lifted by the children and carried here and there about the
room. Let the chairs, in fact let everything be strong and
comfortable in this room. A heavy man is often put to great
inconvenience because the chairs at his disposal are too
flimsy to bear his weight. There are countless stories told
of the Rev. Phillips Brooks, and men of his build, who dare
not laugh at a dinner party lest their chairs resolve themselves
into kindling wood at the first mirthful shake. In my own parlor
there is one chair deep, broad, and of marvelous strength,
bought with an eye to the needs of a friendly neighbor of
grand dimensions. “This is a chair that Mr. B. can’t break,”
said the kindly donor who had witnessed the collapsing of ordinary
parlor chairs under his ponderous weight. Remember
that no chair should be expected to do service that has not
connecting rungs between the legs.</p>

<p>There should be, also, a lounge or sofa in this room, with
ample pillow, not a round horse-hair cylinder, but something
useful, restful, and not too fine. Let the color be as perfect as
may be, but if the material of which it is made be really too
splendid for daily use, its glories should be veiled behind a
strong, washable tidy. I have seen a gray linen square or
towel, with drawn work at the ends, such as costs fifty cents,
perhaps, at the linen shops, with a few long-stemmed poppies
bending together in a row at one end, wrought in outline, with
the familiar legend, “We are all nodding, nid, nid, nodding,”
running sleepily down the center. That had just sentiment
enough, and art enough for its place and use. Tidies are mere
clutter if not intended to be brushed against and used. Paintings
on blue satin, decked out with lace, are out of taste in any
room, however fine, and out of place on any chair. No chair
should be too daintily dressed out to be sat upon; and no
painting should so hang as to invite shoulders clad in black
broadcloth to rub themselves against it. “Tidies” or “chair
backs,” if used at all, should be of a firm material, not easily
crumpled, should be firmly attached, should give off little or
no lint, and should be washed when they are soiled, or thrown
away. They are better when off the white.</p>

<p>There should be a wrap of some sort, afghan, Mexican or
army blanket, railway rug or shawl thrown over the foot of the
sofa, with which to cover up the invalid of the household, or
any one who is tempted to lounge awhile.</p>

<p>Other sitting room comforts, though not essentials, are a
sewing table, stand or basket with drawers or pockets attached,
for the convenience of needlewomen, a portable screen, two-leaved
and not too large, that can shut off draughts from
rheumatic shoulders, and an occasional hassock or footstool—“crickets”
our grandmothers called them in New England.</p>

<p>The covering of tables, chairs, etc., affords an opportunity
to introduce color into the room, but it is not at all necessary
that the chairs should all be covered with stuffs of the same
quality or color. Unless very well chosen, plain colors are
apt to stare, like the sharp green “rep” that was so long
popular, and whose good wearing qualities made it so hard to
displace. If the manufacturers had only kept pace with the
times, and produced the stuff in good, plain shades that would
keep their colors, or figured in good designs, it would still hold
its own against all the so-called tapestry goods that the upholsterers
offer us. “Rep,” however, was utterly unsuitable
for curtains; it was stiff and wiry, and hung in ungainly folds.</p>

<p>For our sitting room some light drapery at the windows is advisable.
If the room has no blinds, there should be some sort of
thick shades or venetian blinds. There is a yellowish brown
holland that is admirable for the purpose; but with outside or inside
blinds, a thin curtain like Madras muslin is all that is necessary
to shade the blackness of the windows at night, or to temper
the brightness of the sunlight by day. The advantage of Madras
muslin or Cretan cloth over lace, muslin, or cheese cloth curtains
lies in the color and figure; colored and figured curtains
showing to better advantage against the light than plain white,
and looking fresher much longer; they “furnish” a room more.</p>

<p>Whatever curtains are used, they should be hung with rings
from rods of brass, bamboo, or wood—varnished pine is good
enough—so that they can be pushed entirely to one side with
ease. Rods should not be too large and should be finished at
the ends with some simple ornament, as a plain ball which
pulls off at one end, so as to allow the rings to slip over the
rod. The curtains may be long, if hung outside the window
frame, and just reach the floor, or they may hang from the upper
sash and just reach to the window ledge, so as to cover only
the window; or they may be half curtains hanging from a small
rod or wire so as to screen only the lower sash. It is not at all
necessary to treat the windows alike. A bay window may
have a long, heavy curtain running across the bay and forming
a nook where two or three may sit cosily together, and the
other windows may be treated to sash or half-sash curtains of
soft silk, Madras muslin, or even Turkey red calico. Where
a window is filled with plants, the little half curtain running
upon a brass wire and falling over the lower sash serves, on
winter nights, as a slight protection for the plants from outer
air, and can be thrust to one side by day, and tucked up out
of sight. A little drapery is a great relief in a room where
there are bare floors and much display of woodwork in doors
and window frames. Then, a portière in place of a closet
door, a hanging before a book case, or curtains at the windows
would relieve the bareness of the room as nothing else could.
Curtains should not repeat the color of the walls, nor should
portières be of the same material and color as the curtains.
Woodwork, however, when painted should repeat the wall
color, though it should be somewhat lighter in shade.</p>

<p>There lacks but little to make our home parlor complete. A
piano, if practice thereon will not interfere with the occupancy
of the room by the household; otherwise let the piano be kept
where music lessons given and studied will not disturb the
family serenity; for many reasons the drawing room is the
best place for the piano, it is more likely to be treated with
respect by mischievous fingers there than in the living room;
and a clock, the plainer the better—no little French fanciful affair,
but something substantial, that can last like the tall, ancestral
eight-day time piece. Should the clock stand on the mantel
it is not essential to have balancing ornaments on either side.
The choicest treasures of the house should indeed adorn the
mantel piece, but it is never necessary to have two of a kind
standing at equal distances from the center.</p>

<p>This is the room in which all things should seem to grow
into a likeness to the household, and to grow old with it. Here
no changes should be made but for good cause, and always
for the better, never by the wholesale. Nor should furniture
be introduced that is so staringly new and gay as to put the
rest out of countenance and make it look shabby by comparison.
There are plenty of good stuffs subdued enough in color
to harmonize with any long used parlor, no matter how old the
carpet nor how faded the chair seats. Whatever is good and
old, though worn, let us respect, preserve, and repair.</p>

<h2 id="NATIONAL_AID_TO_EDUCATION">NATIONAL AID TO EDUCATION.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY GENERAL JOHN A. LOGAN,<br />
U. S. Senator from Illinois.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>To bring to light and expose to public gaze our national defects
or social deformities is an unpleasant and generally
thankless task, but so long as we shirk it, just so long will they
remain to our national detriment and disgrace. To be conscious
of disease, to locate and properly diagnose it, is to be
half-way on the road to good health.</p>

<p>It is not necessary in this age of enlightenment to dwell
upon the manifest and manifold advantages to a people and
to a nation, of education. They are palpable, and conceded
by all men. Illiteracy, then, must as plainly be a disadvantage
to a nation, a hindrance to the advancement and welfare of
its people, and an evil which should be eradicated.</p>

<p>We Americans boast, and boast rightfully, of the high position
in the scale of intelligence we occupy as a people; but
pride in that fact should not blind our eyes to our existing imperfections.
We are proud of the attainments of our men of
letters; we rejoice in the achievements of our scientists and
inventors; we glory in our rapid advance among the nations
to wealth and power; and we fail to give serious heed to the
hundreds of thousands of our people who are growing up every
year in clouded ignorance, without even the rudiments of
education.</p>

<p>If we examine with care our census returns and the reports
of our Bureau of Education, we will be startled by some of the
facts they reveal. To follow many of these revelations in detail
might lead to an accusation of making invidious distinctions,
but there are enough to which the attention of the country
may be called without the shadow of justification for such
a charge. Let us look at these.</p>

<p>Take the Bulletin of “Illiteracy in the United States,” as returned
at the tenth census, and its first line reveals the deplorable
fact that of the 36,761,607 persons of ten years of age and upward,
4,923,451 (over one-seventh) are unable to read, and
6,239,958 (nearly one-sixth) are unable to write.</p>

<p>It appears, moreover, from other census tabulations presented<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
to the United States Senate that, of the 50,155,783
persons constituting our population in 1880, there were equally
proportioned between the white and colored races, 4,204,363 of
both sexes over twenty-one years of age unable to write, or
about 2,000,000 “illiterates” out of the 10,000,000 persons at
that time entitled to vote; or, in other words, one of every five
voters in the United States unable to write his name. From
other statistics of that census it appears also that 1,640,000
voters were unable to read. Thus we have the astounding
assurance that while one in every five voters can not write the
ballot that he wishes to deposit, one in every six voters can not
even read the ballot that he places in the box!</p>

<p>It is this one illiterate voter in every five (or six) voters
who holds the balance of power at our elections.</p>

<p>While a very large proportion of our population, and also of
that portion of it which exercises the elective franchise, can
both read and write, yet a great number of these are very little
the more intelligent because their limited ability to do either
or both is so imperfect and so rarely availed of. Alluding to
these, a committee of the United States Senate (Report 101,
Pt. 2, first session, Forty-eighth Congress), said: “Of those
who can write, multitudes do not place a sentence on paper
twice in a lifetime. Thousands never get an idea from the
printed page.” Yet these are the men who may at any time
subject the country to their control—men who hold the weighty
balance of political power.</p>

<p>To the patriot, to the lover of republican institutions, to the
advocate of unrestricted individual suffrage, this fact is appalling.
But it is none the less a fact that should be known.
Nor may the advocates of monarchical systems of government
and of restricted suffrage take comfort from that fact.
That the deciding ballot in our political contests may be an
ignorant one does not prove the evil or folly of unrestricted
suffrage. Not at all. Cancer in the breast does not prove the
folly of life. Nor is a jammed finger necessarily fatal. These
simply remind us that in the one case the knife, and in the
other the lotion, should be quickly and efficiently used. So
with the ignorant ballot. Its existence merely proves the absolute
necessity of prompt and vigorous action to enlighten it—of
educating him who casts it—of taking counsel from the
past and present and providently guarding the future. It
teaches us that while we are properly horrified at any desecration
of the sacred right of suffrage—whether by bulldozing,
ballot-box stuffing, false counting, or other methods of intimidation
or of fraud—it is high time to arouse ourselves to a
state of facts existing around us and under our very noses,
constituting a sacrilege only differing from these others in degree;
to realize, in time to remedy it, that at every election we
witness, at almost every voting precinct in the land, a constant,
never-failing, almost winked-at desecration by power-clad
ignorance of that right; to realize the great dangers from this
source that we have thus far happily escaped; to properly
apprehend the possible perils thus stored up for us in the
bosom of the future, and by timely, energetic and sufficient
action to arrest them. Thus the very knowledge that one in
every five of our voters exercises ignorantly this undue and
prodigious power must nerve a free and enlightened people to
make immediate and adequate provision both to aid and to
make obligatory the elementary education of those who in due
time will inherit from us the right of suffrage.</p>

<p>It can not be too often or too strongly urged, under the light
of this revelation from the census returns, that an ignorant
ballot is a dangerous ballot, because it may be at once heedless,
and easily deceived; that an educated ballot is, to the
degree of education, an enlightened ballot—possibly wrong-headed
or mistaken at times, but as a rule careful, brave
and pure; and that, as the ballot is placed in the hands of all
Americans, education—the means by which they may discriminatingly
cast that ballot—should be open and free to
all.</p>

<p>The very existence of the Republic depends upon the proper
use of the potential ballot. Education alone can teach that
proper use. Hence it is that “education to all” is the chief
corner stone of the Republic; and to make that secure, no
effort however great, no expense however large, should be
withheld.</p>

<p>Here then, with the fact staring us in the face, that the one
potential vote of every five votes that decides all the great
political questions of the day—questions involving the most
complex and far-reaching principles of government—questions
of finance, of diplomacy, of commerce, of trade, of the tariff,
of the relations of capital and labor, and others whose solution
perplexes the minds of our very ablest statesmen—is an utterly
ignorant vote, can the American people hesitate to demand of
Congress not only immediate but adequate remedial legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in the shape of ample national aid to elementary education
for all of school age, and obligatory attendance within
reasonable limits?</p>

<p>But this is not the only fact bearing heavily upon the question
of the necessity of national aid to our public school system.
If we examine the details of these census tabulations we shall
find that much the larger portion of this illiteracy is found in
some thirteen or fourteen states. Taking these states and territories
in which the proportion of “illiterates” (those unable
to write) to the total state or territorial population of ten years
of age and upward exceeds 25 per cent., we find that ratio to
be: In Alabama, 50.9 per cent.; Arkansas, 38; Florida, 43.4;
Georgia, 49.9; Kentucky, 29.9; Louisiana, 49.1; Mississippi,
49.5; New Mexico, 65; North Carolina, 48.3; South Carolina,
55.4; Tennessee, 38.7; Texas, 29.7; and Virginia, 40.6.
Massing these twelve states and one territory together, we find
they include a population of 10,079,130 of ten years of age and
upward, of which number no less than 4,324,513, or over two
fifths, are unable to write—forty-three out of every one hundred
unable to sign their own names—while of the 26,682,477
persons of like age in the remaining states and territories, the
number of such illiterates is but 1,915,445, or a little over seven
in every one hundred.</p>

<p>We are all of course aware that this large proportion of illiteracy
in the states named is largely owing to the presence of
the colored population. Nevertheless the fact remains that
these people, to whom all the rights of citizenship have been
accorded, and who will hereafter form a very important and
possibly predominating factor in the administration of the affairs
of many of these states, as well as an important factor in
national affairs, must remain for a long time in ignorance unless
some other means of educating them be adopted than
that which now obtains.</p>

<p>But let no one deceive himself with the idea that this undue
and lamentable ratio of illiteracy in these particular states is
due wholly to the presence of the colored population. Unfortunately
illiteracy prevails to a very considerable and almost
an alarming extent among their native white population also.
Thus the census tabulations show that the proportion of
“illiterates” (those unable to write), in the total native white
population, ten years of age and upward, is: In Alabama, 25
percent.; Arkansas, 25.5; Florida, 20.7; Georgia, 23.2; Kentucky,
22.8; Louisiana, 19.8; Mississippi, 16.6; New Mexico,
64.2; North Carolina, 31.7; South Carolina, 22.4; Tennessee,
27.8; Texas, 13.9; and Virginia, 18.5. Massing them we find
that of the 6,010,714 native whites, ten years of age and upward,
within the territorial limits mentioned, there are as many
as 1,395,441—being 23.2 per cent., or nearly one in every four
of the whites—unable to write. It is evident, therefore, that
the surprising illiteracy in these states is not wholly attributable
to the presence therein of the colored race.</p>

<p>It is somewhat humiliating to have to confess to the world
by our own official figures that one out of every four of the
native whites over ten years of age in twelve states and one
territory of our Republic is unable to write his own name, especially
when we compare it with the additional fact, derived
from the same tabulation, that the illiteracy of the foreign born
of these same localities does not rise in any instance above
10.9 per cent.</p>

<p>Turning to the other side of the picture we may find some
grains of comparative consolation in observing the fact that of
the remaining 19,775,075 native whites, ten years of age and
upward, in the United States only 860,019—or 4.3 per cent.,
being one in twenty-three—are unable to write. This favorable
condition of one part of the country, however, only serves
to bring out in sharper contrast the sad condition of the other
part, and should spur the philanthropist and statesman to renewed
and more strenuous effort to obliterate, or at least
ameliorate, this alarming sectional inequality in the degree of
illiteracy.</p>

<p>Were it not for the hope of ultimately removing this inequality
by attaining an educational homogeneity or equality
on the higher level as between the sections, one might almost
be tempted to wish for an educational equalization on the
lower grade; for as long as that inequality continues to exist,
so long must it prove a source of irritation and danger in a
thousand forms.</p>

<p>As to the situation in the old slave states, where the colored
population is proportionately large, it is not difficult to understand
it. We can appreciate the dread on the part of the
whites of an “uprising,” as it is termed, of the colored people.
But the words of Jefferson<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>—possibly prophetic unless averted
by the exercise of wisdom and fairness—have in them a depth
of meaning that none but those whites can fully realize when,
speaking of the slaves, he says: “And can the liberties of a
nation be thought secure when we have removed their only
firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these
liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated
but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I
reflect that God is just; that his justice can not sleep forever;
that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a
<i>revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is
among the possible events</i>; that it may become probable by
supernatural interference! The Almighty has no attribute
which can take sides with us in such a contest.”</p>

<p>Aside from the overawing influence of a large standing army
there is but one thing that can prevent a race-conflict, the very
possibility of which we dread to contemplate, and that is the
benign and liberalizing influence of education, resulting in a
free and untrammeled exercise of the elective franchise. Give
the former and you will unquestionably secure the latter.</p>

<p>That the local as well as sectional inequality in education
can be overcome by no other means than by national aid, will
be further demonstrated. Nor is it just that we should expect
or ask it to be otherwise. No matter now what may have
caused this inequality, the fact that it exists is that which now
momentously concerns us. We know it can not be removed
by recurring to the cause; and it will become more and more
evident as we examine the subject that only by speedy and
efficient congressional action can we now insure that future
educational equilibrium, not only between the races and between
the sections, but also between the people in each state,
which will have so important a bearing upon the destinies of
this nation, and is so essential to the continued peace, prosperity
and contentment of its people.</p>

<p>Another fact of great importance, as bearing upon the necessity
for national aid to education, is revealed by the census
returns. It is a curious as well as an important revelation, because
it shows that the ratio of children or persons under
twenty-one years of age to the adults, is considerably larger in
some states than in others, and correspondingly increases the
educational burden.</p>

<p>The principle involved in this condition of affairs may be
simply illustrated thus: Suppose the head of each family
had to pay directly for the education of his own children.
Then, even with an equality of means, the burden would, as a
matter of course, fall heavier on the one with a numerous
than the one with a small progeny.</p>

<p>To make apparent the effect of this inequality in the proportion
of minors to adults in different parts of our common country,
let us suppose that the mean average cost of schooling is
four dollars per annum for each child.</p>

<p>It appears that in Connecticut, out of every one hundred
persons, fifty-nine are adults, and forty-one are minors. At this
supposed rate, then, the fifty-nine adults would have each to pay
two dollars and seventy-eight cents per annum in order to make
up the one hundred and sixty-four dollars per annum needed
for the education of the forty-one children. It appears also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that in South Carolina, out of every one hundred persons, forty-three
are adults and fifty-seven are minors. At the supposed
rate, then, these forty-three adults would have each to pay
five dollars and thirty cents per annum in order to make up
the two hundred and twenty-eight dollars per annum needed
for the education of the fifty-seven children.</p>

<p>Now, this is a very important fact, indeed, and must lead all
fair minded advocates of education to modify somewhat the
criticisms they may have made touching the expenditure in the
South for education as compared with that in the North and
West; for here it becomes palpable that two dollars and seventy-eight
cents per adult in Connecticut is equivalent to five
dollars and thirty cents per adult in South Carolina for the
schooling of the children respectively, in those states. Nearly
twice as much in one state as in the other.</p>

<p>But this result is from an assumed uniform mean average
standard of the cost of educating each child in the Union. Let
us test the matter by a comparison founded on actual cost.
Take, for instance, the states of Maine and Mississippi.</p>

<p>In Maine there are fifty-eight adults to forty-two minors in
every one hundred persons. In Mississippi there are forty-three
adults to fifty-seven minors in every one hundred persons.
In Maine<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> the educational expenditure per capita of the
school population is four dollars and sixty-seven cents per
annum. This enforces an annual expenditure for this purpose
of three dollars and thirty-eight cents by each adult. An equal
school tax of four dollars and sixty-seven cents per annum for
each scholar, imposed upon the adult population of Mississippi
would call for six dollars and nineteen cents from each adult—or
nearly twice what the adult of Maine must pay.</p>

<p>The effects of this disparity will be more fully dwelt upon at
a later period. But it must surely be already apparent that
this inequality of the educational burden created by the disparity
existing between the populations of various portions of our
country can alone be met and remedied by some aid from the
general government.</p>

<p>It is true that the facts thus far adduced indicate rather the
necessity for national assistance to certain sections or states
than for general and uniform aid to all. But a further study and
the development of other facts will, as we proceed, more fully
reveal, not alone the wisdom and necessity of such aid to all,
but the character and extent of the aid required.</p>

<p>Before we reach that period, however, there are facts touching
other phases of inequality of burden that are worthy of
close and careful consideration.</p>

<p>Careful tabulations from the census returns show that a
school enrollment of 22.4 per cent. of the total population of
Missouri amounts to but 88.6 per cent. of the school population
of that state, fixing the standard of school age as between
six and sixteen years; while a school enrollment of 22 per cent.
of the total population of New Jersey is equal to<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> 101.5 per
cent. of her school population. Hence, although Missouri has
a somewhat larger percentage in school of her total population
than has New Jersey, yet she lacks more than 11 per cent.
of having all her children of school age enrolled as scholars;
while a slightly smaller per cent. of her total population places
more than all the school age children of New Jersey in school.
So also with Vermont, where a school enrollment of 22 per
cent. of the total population gives 109.5 per cent. in school, of
all of school age.</p>

<p>Comparing Nebraska and Connecticut, we find that while
22.3 per cent. of the total population of the former state enrolled
in the schools amounts to but 95.4 per cent. of her children
of school age, 21.3 per cent. of the total population of
the latter state enrolled in the schools is equivalent to 110.3 per cent. of
her children of school age.</p>

<p>Massachusetts has to send 19.2 per cent. of her total population
to school in order to equal 104.8 per cent. of her children
of school age, while Illinois has to send to school 24.5 per
cent. of her population to reach a like ratio of enrolled scholars
to children of school age.</p>

<p>Even in states situated so near to each other as Pennsylvania
and New York we observe this inequality. In the former,
where the school enrollment is 22.8 per cent. of the total population,
it is but 99.4 per cent. of the children of school age,
while in New York 23 per cent. of the total population enrolled
in the schools is 112.4 per cent. of her children of school age.</p>

<p>Thus far have been selected for comparison some of those
states the ratios of whose school enrollment to the total population
were about the same. But while these contrasts bring
out very clearly the inequality in the burden of educating the
children of our country, yet there are more marked illustrations
at hand.</p>

<p>Take Arkansas, West Virginia and New York, for instance.
In Arkansas the school enrollment is 13.5 per cent. of population,
and but 51.3 per cent. of the children of school age. At
the same ratio a school enrollment of 23 per cent. of total population
in Arkansas would be but 87.4 per cent. of the children
of school age. West Virginia has a school enrollment of 23.3
per cent. of total population, which is only 87.9 per cent. of her
children of school age. Yet New York, as we have already
seen, by an enrollment of 23 per cent. of her total population
secures schooling for 113.3 per cent.—more than all—of her
children of school age.</p>

<p>Comparing other states, one with the other—such as Alabama
with Maine, Georgia with New Hampshire, Tennessee
with Rhode Island, Mississippi with Massachusetts, etc.—we
see similar, and in some cases even greater inequality.</p>

<p>Let us now apply these facts practically, and thus reach a
clearer understanding of the effect of this great disparity.</p>

<p>The actual mean average cost of the schooling of each public
school scholar in the United States is about ten dollars. Assuming
then that the adult population of each state bears the
burden of educating its children, and that all the children of
school age in each state are enrolled in the schools—as they
should be—let us ascertain how much the tax per capita would
be on the adults bearing this burden in each state and territory.
In other words, let us discover how much in each state
and territory must every adult (male or female) pay every year
in order to supply the ten dollars per annum that it costs to
educate each and every child in that state or territory.</p>

<p>It would cost each adult in Montana, $1.95; in Wyoming, $2.12;
Nevada, $2.12; Colorado, $2.20; Arizona, $2.34; New Hampshire,
$2.78; Idaho, $3.00; Massachusetts, $3.23; Dakota, $3.30;
Rhode Island, $3.22; California, $3.33; Connecticut, $3.27;
Maine, $3.43; Vermont, $3.46; New York, $3.56; District of
Columbia, $3.77; Washington, $3.94; New Jersey, $4.02; Michigan,
$4.15; Oregon, $4.29; Delaware, $4.31; Pennsylvania,
$4.26; Ohio, $4.55; Maryland, $4.55; Nebraska, $4.77; Minnesota,
$4.70; New Mexico, $4.65; Wisconsin, $4.86; Illinois,
$4.88; Indiana, $5.00; Iowa, $5.10; Missouri, $5.28; Kansas,
$5.32; Louisiana, $5.54; North Carolina, $5.67; Virginia, $5.59;
Texas, $5.86; Kentucky, $5.65; Florida, $5.78; Utah, $6.07;
Alabama, $6.12; Arkansas, $6.12; Georgia, $5.98; South Carolina,
$5.98; Tennessee, $6.00; West Virginia, $5.86, and Mississippi,
$6.28—while, massing the entire Union, the cost to each
adult in it would be $4.70.</p>

<p>Thus we find that while the school tax on each adult in New
York would be but $3.56, in the adjoining state of Pennsylvania
it would be $4.26; that while in Massachusetts it would be
but $3.23, in Illinois it would be $4.88—a difference of $1.65 per
capita to the adult; that while in New Hampshire it would be
but $2.78, in Mississippi it would be more than double that
amount. But the reader can himself, by a glance at the list
presented, perceive even more glaring inequalities than these
in the relative burdens which would be imposed upon the adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
population of the various states and territories, were that burden
to be placed entirely on their shoulders.</p>

<p>If it be the true policy of a nation to equalize, as far as possible,
the necessary burdens imposed upon its people, then we
certainly have before us in these statistics, a condition of facts
demanding serious consideration and efficacious action by the
general government.</p>

<p>If inequality in the burdens imposed in order to educate
our children be any argument in favor of national aid to education—and
who will venture to deny it?—then we have in these
statistics positive evidence of very great and possibly hitherto
unsuspected inequalities; inequalities of which none could be
aware without a close and critical analysis of the figures, the
developments of which as previously hinted, may well cause
us to modify somewhat the reproaches we may have felt inclined
to cast upon some of our states for what seemed to be a
lack of proper effort on their part in the direction of education.</p>

<p>While, however, reproachful criticism of them still appears
to some extent justifiable, yet the deductions from rearrangement
and classification of the census and educational bureau
tables show that the fault does not altogether lie at the doors
of those among whom the greatest amount of illiteracy is
found.</p>

<p>In order to make this clear let us examine the ratio of children
enrolled in schools, not to the state, but to the adult population.
That ratio is, in Alabama, 34.6 per cent.; Arkansas,
31.4; California, 35.2; Colorado, 17.7; Connecticut, 36.1; Delaware,
34.6; District of Columbia, 32.1; Florida, 35.8; Georgia,
42; Illinois, 50; Indiana, 54.3; Iowa, 56; Kansas, 53.8;
Kentucky, 36.3; Louisiana, 19.8; Maine, 40; Maryland, 31.4;
Massachusetts, 33.5; Michigan, 44; Minnesota, 47.8; Mississippi,
48.6; Missouri, 47.7; Nebraska, 45.5; New Hampshire,
31.3; New Jersey, 40.7; New York, 40.3; North Carolina, 40.7;
Ohio, 47.8; Pennsylvania, 42.2; Rhode Island, 30.2; South
Carolina, 32.3; Tennessee, 49.1; Texas, 25.2; Utah, 44.4; Vermont,
38; Virginia, 35.4; West Virginia, 51.8; Wisconsin, 50.4,
and in the entire Union, 42 per cent.</p>

<p>Now, the mean average number of children in the United
States enrolled in the schools being forty-two to every one
hundred adults, what is our surprise to find, in the figures just
given, that every New England state, as well as New York,
New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, falls below this average,
while on the other hand, every northwestern state (including
Ohio, Missouri and Kansas), as well as Mississippi,
Tennessee and West Virginia, stands above it!</p>

<p>That in proportion to the adult population of those states,
there are more children at school in Mississippi, Tennessee
and West Virginia, than in any of the New England states, is,
indeed, an astounding revelation.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, the cost of educating a child in those states
to be the same, it follows that each one hundred adults in Mississippi,
Tennessee, and West Virginia are paying more to
educate their children than is paid by the same number of adults
in any New England state!</p>

<p>At first sight these statistical results fairly stagger one, and
give rise to doubts of their accuracy. But a careful examination
of them will satisfy any reasonable mind that these developments
are veritable facts, if the census returns and the school
enrollment reported by the Commissioners of Education are
to be accepted—being based upon and directly calculated from
them. Even supposing the existence of some deficiencies in
the returns or some minor errors in the calculations, the general
facts they reveal must be accepted as true.</p>

<p>“Let the trust of <span class="smcap">James Smithson</span> to the United States of America
be faithfully executed by their representatives in Congress, let the result
accomplish his object, ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men,’ and a wreath of more unfading verdure shall entwine
itself in the lapse of future ages around the name of Smithson, than
the united hands of tradition, history, and poetry have braided around
the name of Percy through the long perspective in ages past of a thousand
years.”—<i>John Quincy Adams.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The name of the Smithsonian Institution is a household
word throughout North America, and its fame is current
wherever printed literature exists. Abroad it is regarded as
the chief exponent of the scientific activities of the people of
the United States, and the administrative scientific department
of our government. At home, its actual relations to the administration
are better understood, and it is looked upon in its
proper capacity—that of an organization closely affiliated to
the government and tenderly cherished by its officers, yet, in
virtue of its independent foundation, independent of political
favor, and ready to encourage, advise and coöperate with any
public or private enterprise without the necessity of annual
appeals to the congressional committees on appropriations.</p>

<p>Visitors to the national capital usually carry away pleasant
memories of the quiet old building among the trees in the
mall, with its mediæval battlements and turrets of brown stone
conspicuous from every point of view, and the multitude who
enter its halls are at least impressed with the fact that the
national treasure houses are becoming filled with valuable collections
rather faster than the available money and space will
allow to be properly arranged and displayed. Only a very
few, however, of the four hundred thousand persons who visited
the buildings last year can have had the opportunity to inspect
the administrative offices or the scientific laboratories,
and very few indeed of those who are acquainted with the
general nature of the operations of the establishment, have
the slightest conception of their meaning and importance.</p>

<p>No class of American people, except indeed our scientific
investigators, better understand and appreciate the work of
the Institution than do our members of Congress, as is clearly
shown by the uniform liberality with which, throughout many
successive terms, regardless of changes in the political complexion
of the administration, they have supported its policy, by the
care with which they disseminate its reports, by the judgment
with which they select their representatives in its board of regents,
and above all, by the scrupulous care with which they
have protected its independence from political complications.
Through the disinterested labors of Washington correspondents,
novelists, and playwrights, the average congressman of
current, popular belief, is not a person remarkable either for
manners, honesty or intellect. Residents of Washington, however,
do not find the representative men at the Capital counterparts
of the eminent politicians depicted by the author of
“Democracy,” but in their stead, practical men of business,
hard-working in their committees and hard-worked by their
constituents. It is its support by these men, and through
them by the people of the United States, that has enabled the
Smithsonian Institution to do its work in the past. It is to such
support that it will owe its efficiency in the future, and it seems
right that every opportunity should be taken to explain its
operations to the public. Representatives of the best classes of
thinking Americans will no doubt thoroughly appreciate the
benefits which education has received and will continue to receive
from the proper administration of the Smithsonian bequest.</p>

<p>The story of the foundation of the Institution sounds more
like a romance than like fact. Its history seems like the fulfillment
of some ancient prophecy—even more strikingly so
because it is evident that the future is to fulfill the promise of
the past. The father of the founder of the Smithsonian Institution
was one of the most distinguished members of the English
peerage. Upon the plate of his coffin in Westminster Abbey,
where he was buried “in great pomp” in 1786, he is described
as “the most high, puissant and most noble prince Hugh
Percy, Duke and Earl of Northumberland, Earl Percy, Baron
Warkworth and Lovaine, Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum
of the Counties of Middlesex and Northumberland, Vice
Admiral of the County of Northumberland and of all America,
one of the Lords of His Majesty’s most Honorable Privy
Council and Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter,
etc., etc.” While his aged father was sustaining this overwhelming
accumulation of dignities, and while his elder
brother, Earl Percy, was acting as Lieutenant-General in the
war against the rebellious British colonies in North America
(he commanded the reinforcements at the battle of Lexington
in 1775, and led the column that reduced Fort Washington,
near New York in 1776), James Smithson, a youth of modest
fortune, inherited from his mother, was laying the foundations
of a scientific education in the English schools and colleges,
receiving the degree of Master of Arts at Pembroke College,
Oxford, in 1786, the year of his father’s death. He was then
known as James Louis Macie, Esq., and did not assume the
name of Smithson until fourteen years later, after he had attained
to some reputation as a man of science. His mother
was not the Duchess of Northumberland, but a cousin of her
father’s, Elizabeth Hungerford, who was subsequently known
as Mrs. Macie. She appears to have been the daughter and
heiress of Sir George Hungerford of Audley and the Hon.
Frances Seymour, sister of the Duke of Somerset and aunt of
Algernon Seymour, Lord Percy, by marriage with whose
daughter Sir Hugh Smithson was enabled to assume the name
of Percy and the title of Duke of Northumberland. The
Smithsons were an old Yorkshire family, Sir Hugh Smithson,
the great-grandfather of James Smithson, having been created
baronet in 1660 by Charles II. after his restoration. The
names of Percy and Northumberland were, as has been stated,
assumed by James Smithson’s father. These barren, genealogical
details are referred to because they seem to be necessary
to the understanding of James Smithson’s career.</p>

<p>Proud of his descent he undoubtedly was. In his will he
describes his identity himself in these words: “I, James
Smithson, son of Hugh, first Duke of Northumberland and
Elizabeth, heiress of the Hungerfords of Audley, and niece to
Charles the Proud, Duke of Somerset.” He was, however, a
man of broad, philosophic mind, in whom a thorough training
in the best scientific methods of his day, and associations with
leading investigators in Germany and France, and his brother
Fellows of the Royal Society of London, had developed a generous
appreciation of the value of scholarship and scientific
culture.</p>

<p>In one of his manuscripts was found the following sentiment,
which I have already referred to as prophetic in its ring:</p>

<p>“The best blood of England flows in my veins; on my
father’s side I am a Northumberland, on my mother’s I am
related to kings, but this avails me not. <i>My name shall live
in the memory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands
and the Percys are extinct and forgotten.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>These words came to my mind last summer in London when
I saw the present Duke of Northumberland, grandson of
Smithson’s half-brother, a feeble old man, still one of England’s
greatest dignitaries, following in the train of the Prince
of Wales, and rising to falter out a feeble speech proposing a
vote of thanks to His Royal Highness for presiding at one of the
conferences of the International Fisheries’ Exhibition, upon
the occasion of an address by Prof. Huxley, president of the
Royal Society. The name of the Smithsonian Institution has
a world-wide fame; but who outside of English court circles
ever heard of Algernon George Percy, Duke of Northumberland?</p>

<p>Smithson seems early in life to have become imbued with
the scientific spirit of his time. In 1784, while still an undergraduate
at Oxford, he made a scientific exploration of the
coasts of Scotland in company with a party of geologists. In
1787 he was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
during the remaining forty-two years of his life, a considerable
portion of which was passed upon the continent, in Berlin,
Paris, Rome, Florence and Geneva, he was the associate of
the leading men of science, and devoted himself to research.
He made an extensive collection of minerals, which was destroyed
by the burning of a portion of the Smithsonian building
in 1865, and always carried with him a portable chemical
laboratory. His contributions to science are included in
twenty-seven memoirs, chiefly upon topics in mineralogy and
organic chemistry, but a number of them relating to applied
science and the industrial arts.</p>

<p>His work was by no means of an epoch-making character,
but seems to have been remarkable for its minute accuracy.
Smithson was a much greater man than his published writings
would indicate. In his eulogy the president of the Royal Society
remarked: “He carried with him the esteem of various
private friends, and of a still larger number of persons who
admired and appreciated his acquirements.” He was evidently
a man of broad, general culture, who understood
thoroughly the needs of the world in the direction of scientific
endowment, and whose action in bequeathing his estate to the
people of America was deliberate and well considered.</p>

<p>In his admirable little monograph entitled “Smithson and
His Bequest,” Mr. W. J. Rhees has shown the tendency of the
time of Smithson to have been in the direction of establishing
permanent scientific institutions. Between 1782 and 1826,
over twenty of the most important academies and societies
now in existence were organized. This period he remarks
“was not less marked by the gloom occasioned by long protracted
and almost universal war, and the extent and rapidity
of its social changes, than by the luster of its brilliant discoveries
in science, and its useful inventions in the arts. Pure,
abstract science had many illustrious votaries, and the practical
applications of its truths gave to the world many of the
great inventions by means of which civilization has made such
immense and rapid progress.” He quotes in support of these
statements the words of Lord Brougham, the representative
statesman of the day. “To instruct the people in the rudiments
of philosophy,” Brougham remarked, “would of itself
be an object sufficiently brilliant to allure the noblest ambition.”</p>

<p>He recommended this idea to the wealthy men of England,
pointing out how, by the promotion of such ends, a man, however
averse to the turmoil of public affairs, may enjoy the
noblest gratification of which the most aspiring nature is susceptible,
and may influence by his single exertions the character
and fortunes of a whole generation.</p>

<p>Very closely do these ideas agree with those expressed by
Smithson in various passages in his note books, especially
with that which is used for a motto upon the publications of
the Institution: “Every man is a valuable member of society
who, by his observations, researches, and experiments, procures
knowledge for men.” Or this: “It is in his knowledge
that man has found his greatness and his happiness, the high
superiority which he holds over the other animals who inherit
the earth with him, and consequently, no ignorance is probably
without loss to him, no error without evil.”</p>

<p>It was with a mind full of such thoughts as these, with perhaps
the support and inspiration of Lord Brougham’s words
quoted above from his “Treatise on Popular Education,”
printed in 1825, with such models in mind as the Royal Society,
whose object is “the improvement of natural knowledge,”
the Royal Institution “for diffusing the knowledge and facilitating
the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions
and improvements, and for teaching the application of
science to the common purposes of life,” and the Society for
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge established in London in
1825, that in 1826 Smithson drew up his will containing the
following weighty provision: “<i>I bequeath the whole of my
property to the United States of America to found at Washington,
under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.</i>”</p>

<p>No one has been able to show why he selected the United
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances
in America, nor does he appear to have had any books relating
to America save two. Rhees quotes from one of these,
“Travels Through North America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary
of the Royal Society, a paragraph concerning Washington,
then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in which it is predicted
that “the Federal city, as soon as navigation is perfected, will
increase most rapidly, and that at a future day, if the affairs
of the United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will
become the grand emporium of the West, and rival in magnitude
and splendor the cities of the whole world.”</p>

<p>Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation,
realizing that while the needs of England were well met by
existing organizations such as would not be likely to spring up
for many years in a new, poor, and growing country, he
founded in the new England an institution of learning, the
civilizing power of which has been of incalculable value.
Who can attempt to say what the condition of the United
States would have been to-day without this bequest? In the
words of John Quincy Adams: “Of all the foundations of
establishments for pious or charitable uses which ever signalized
the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence of
the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation
of mankind.”</p>

<p>When the fact of the bequest became known, some six years
after Smithson’s death, much opposition was shown in Congress
toward its acceptance. Eminent statesmen like Calhoun
and Preston argued that it was beneath the dignity of the
United States to receive presents, and that it was too cheap a
way of conferring immortality on the donor. The wise counsels
and enthusiastic labors of John Quincy Adams, who
seems to have had from the first a thorough appreciation of
the importance of the matter, finally prevailed, and the Hon.
Richard Rush was sent to England to prosecute the claim.
He entered suit in the Courts of Chancery, in the name of the
President of the United States, and in less than two years—an
event unparalleled in the Court of Chancery—had obtained a
favorable decision. The legacy was brought over in the form
of 104,960 gold sovereigns which were delivered September
1st, 1838, to the Philadelphia mint, where they were immediately
recoined into American money, producing $508,318.46,
as the first installment of the Smithsonian legacy. This was
increased in 1861 to $534,529.09.</p>

<p>For eight years the legacy lay in the Treasury, while the wise
men of the nation tried to decide what to do with it. In this
instance the adage that in the multitude of counselors there
is wisdom did not appear to be applicable in the ordinary interpretation.
The delay, though irksome to those who desired
to see immediate results, was, however, the best thing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
end for the interests of the trust. Every imaginable disposition
of the legacy was proposed and discussed in Congress; the
debates fill nearly three hundred and fifty pages of Rhees’s
compilation of Smithsonian documents. Letters by the hundred,
advisory, expostulatory and dissuasive were received from
representative thinkers and from societies at home and abroad.
Every man had a scheme peculiar to himself, and opposed all
other schemes with a vigor proportionate to their dissimilarity
to his own. Schools of every grade, from a national university
to an agricultural school, a normal school and a school for
the blind were proposed. A library, a botanical garden, an observatory,
a chemical laboratory, a popular publishing house,
a lecture lyceum, an art museum, any and all of these and
many more were proposed and advocated by this voluntary
congress of many men of many minds. It is not necessary in
this place to discuss the history of the period at length, nor to
relate the manner in which the prevalence of wiser councils
was brought about. It is sufficient to say that though the new
institution was burdened from the start with various undertakings
which have since proved unprofitable or better suited to
the capacity of other institutions, such have been the flexibility
of its organization and the vitality of its membership that it has
been able to work out a career for itself unparalleled in the history
of benevolent foundations.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the accomplishment of these effects
was the result of long continued effort on the part of men of
unusual ability, energy and personal influence. No board of
trustees or regents, no succession of officers serving out their
terms in rotation could have developed from a chaos of conflicting
opinions, a strongly individualized establishment like
the Smithsonian Institution. The names of Joseph Henry and
Spencer F. Baird are so thoroughly identified with that of the
Institution that their biographies combined would form an almost
complete history of its operations. A thirty-two years’
term of uninterrupted administrative service has been rendered
by one, thirty-four years by the other. It is very doubtful
whether any other institution has ever had the benefit of such
an uninterrupted administration of thirty-eight years, beginning
with its birth and continuing in an unbroken line of consistent
policy a career of increasing usefulness and enterprise.</p>

<p>Joseph Henry, the first secretary, entered upon his duties at
the end of the year 1846, a man already famous as an investigator
in physical science, a professor of fourteen years’ standing
in Princeton College, and recognized as eminent in scientific
and general acquirements. From the age of forty-seven
to that of seventy-nine, his life was merged in that of the Institution.
Professor Asa Gray has pointed out so clearly the
deep impression which he made upon the Institution while it
was yet plastic, that I venture to quote his words in order to
explain the character of this new force in the evolution of
good results from the Smithson benefaction. “Some time before
his appointment,” writes Professor Gray, “he had been
requested by members of the Board of Regents to examine
the will of Smithson and to suggest a plan of organization by
which the object of the bequest might, in his opinion, best
be realized. He did so, and the plan he drew was in their
hands when he was chosen secretary. The plan was based on
the conviction ‘that the intention of the donor was to advance
science by original research and publication; that the establishment
was for the benefit of mankind generally, and that all
unnecessary expenditures on local objects would be violations
of the trust.’ His ‘Programme of Organization’ was submitted
to the Board of Regents in the following year, was
adopted as its governing policy, and has been reprinted in full
or in part in almost every annual report. If the Institution is
now known and praised throughout the world of science and
letters, if it is fulfilling the will of its founder and the reasonable
expectations of the nation which accepted and established
the trust, the credit is mainly due to the practical wisdom, the
catholic spirit, and the indomitable perseverance of its first
secretary, to whom the establishing act gave much power of
shaping ends, which as rough-hewn by Congress were susceptible
of various diversion. Henry took his stand on the broad
and ample terms of the bequest, ‘for the increase and diffusion
of useful knowledge among men,’ and he never narrowed
his mind and to <i>locality</i> gave what was meant for mankind.
He proposed only one restriction, of wisdom and necessity,
that in view of the limited means of the Institution, it
ought not to undertake anything which could be done, and
well done, by other existing instrumentalities. So as occasion
arose he lightened its load and saved its energies by
giving over to other agencies some of its cherished work.”
The character of the work done in manifold directions will be
discussed topically below; its spirit is sufficiently indicated in
Dr. Gray’s terse summary just quoted. Professor Henry died
in 1878. “Remembering his great career as a man of science,”
remarked President Garfield, “as a man who served his Government
with singular ability and faithfulness, who was loved and
venerated by every circle who was blessed with the light of
his friendship, the worthiest and the best, whose life added
new luster to the glory of the human race, we shall be most
fortunate if ever in the future we see his like again.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> His
statue, erected by Congress, stands in the Smithsonian Park.</p>

<p>Concerning the influence of Professor Baird, upon whom
the mantle of his predecessor has descended, it would perhaps
be premature and out of taste to speak. His eminence as a
naturalist and his patriotic service as Commissioner of Fisheries
are too well known to need mention, and indeed may be
quite as appropriately discussed elsewhere. As assistant secretary
from the age of twenty-four he was intimately associated
with Professor Henry for twenty-seven years, and his executive
ability found full scope in the development of the systems
of publication and international exchange, as well as the museum,
and the explorations, biological and ethnological, which
were from the beginning under his charge. As secretary his
policy has been a direct continuation of that of Professor
Henry. The services of Mr. William J. Rhees, for thirty-two
years chief clerk, merit also especial notice.</p>

<p>The formal direction of the Institution is vested in a board of
regents, consisting of the Vice President and Chief Justice of
the United States, three members each from the Senate and
the House of Representatives, and six persons citizens of the
United States appointed by Congress. The President and his
cabinet are <i>ex officio</i> members of the Institution, and there is
a provision, not at present carried into effect, providing for the
election of honorary members of the Institution. The secretary
is the only executive officer of the board, and is responsible
to the board for his conduct of affairs. The regents meet
once a year in January. Many eminent men have served in
the capacity of regents, and the records of their proceedings
indicate that their interest in the work under their charge has
been uniformly very active.</p>

<p>The building occupied by the Institution and bearing its
name is an ornate structure of Seneca brown stone, occupying
a prominent position in the “Mall” which extends from the
Capitol to the Washington monument. This building was begun
in 1847 and completed in 1855. It is hybrid in character,
combining features selected from both Gothic and Romanesque
style, and is more admired by the public than by connoisseurs
in architecture. It is doubtful if a building more
unsuited to the purposes for which it was designed was ever
constructed. The diversion of the funds of the Smithsonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
bequest to this building was one of Professor Henry’s greatest
griefs, and before the close of his life by careful economy of
the annual income, he had succeeded in restoring the entire
sum, amounting to about $450,000 to the permanent endowment
fund, beside increasing this fund nearly $150,000 over
and above the original bequest. The eastern wing of the
building, for so many years the hospitable home of the secretary,
has been reconstructed internally, and the offices of the
Institution are all established within its walls. The remainder
of the building is occupied by laboratories and exhibition halls
connected with the National Museum. Another building has
recently been built east of the Smithsonian for the reception of
a portion of the national collections. This was put up by congressional
appropriation, and Congress has at last recognized
the justice of the claim, so many years urged upon them by
the secretary, that the Smithson money should not be used
to provide shelter for the government cabinets, and has assumed
the care of the Smithsonian building and votes money
for its repairs and maintenance.</p>

<p>Few people who visit Washington make the proper discrimination
between the Smithsonian Institution proper, and the
establishments under its custody. What they see is the National
Museum. The relations of the Museum to the Institution
will be discussed more fully in a separate article, but it is
necessary to state just here that it is not the property of the
Institution, but rather its ward—its management being intrusted
by law to the Institution which is provided with funds for its
maintenance by annual congressional grants. In early days
the Smithsonian supported collections of its own, but these
were not primarily for public exhibition, but for the uses of
scientific investigators. Professor Henry always maintained
that not one cent of the Smithson fund could with propriety be
applied to the support of the National Museum, and his view
is now the accepted one.</p>

<p>In the Smithsonian proper, little is to be seen by visitors.
In the regents’ room is an interesting collection of relics of the
founder, including his portrait, his scientific library, and certain
of his pictures and personal effects. Beside the regents’
room there are offices, store rooms and packing rooms occupied
by busy clerks and mechanics. The Smithsonian is, first
of all, an executive establishment, to which have been confided
various trusts, to be mentioned hereafter. It is also a publishing
house, and an “exchange” for the reception and transmission
of scientific materials. The great masses of books in
brown wrappers and cases of papers, apparatus and specimens
constitute therefore the greater bulk of the material with which
it has to deal.</p>

<p>The leading feature of the plan proposed by Professor
Henry was from the first “to assist men of science in making
original researches, to publish them in a series of volumes, and
to give a copy of them to every first-class library on the face of
the earth.” The manner in which the first item of policy has
been carried out can not be described here. Those who wish to
know how it has been done must consult the thirty-four thick
volumes of the annual reports, presented to and printed by Congress.
It is safe to say, however, in general terms that there
is probably not a scientific investigator in America to whom
the helping hand of the Institution has not at some time been
of service, and that assistance of this sort has been by no
means restricted to this side of the Atlantic. Books, apparatus
and laboratory accommodations have been supplied in thousands
of instances, and every year a certain number of money
grants have been made. Not less important has been the personal
encouragement afforded, especially to beginners and
persons remote from other advice, in the hundreds of thousands
of letters which have been written by the two secretaries during
the seventy years of their added terms of office. No communication
is ever passed by unnoticed and the archive rooms
of the Institution packed from floor to ceiling with letter files
and letter copy books are well worthy of inspection.</p>

<p>The publications of the establishment are as numerous as
those of a great publishing house, and as a matter of fact, they
are all given away; although there is a provision for their sale
at cost price, I doubt if a thousand dollars’ worth has been sold
in five years. There are three series, the aspect of which must
be familiar to every observing person who has ever spent a day
among the shelves in any American library of respectable
standing. The Smithsonian “Contributions to Knowledge,”
now including twenty-three stately volumes quarto with 116
memoirs, in all 12,456 pages, and numerous fine plates, the
Smithsonian miscellaneous collection, in octavo, containing
122 papers with 20,299 pages, and thirty-five annual reports.
The papers included in these volumes are all published separately,
the number of separate volumes printed up to this time
being above 500. These include papers varying in length
from 4 to 1,000 pages, by the most eminent specialists in every
branch of science. The most recent work, one now in progress,
two volumes having been published, is a systematic work on
the botany of North America by Dr. Asa Gray; another is
an illustrated work on prehistoric fishing, by Dr. Charles
Rau.</p>

<p>I have never seen an estimate of the value of the books distributed
during the thirty-eight years, but I should judge that
it can not fall below $1,000,000, estimating the prices at standing
publishing rates.</p>

<p>In addition to the direct publications of the Institution let us
look at the numerous magnificent volumes of scientific reports
printed in more or less direct coöperation with the Institution
by the various government surveys and exploring expeditions,
at government expense. Who can doubt that the extent of
this literature, which is a constant source of comment in foreign
scientific journals, where it is desired to stimulate European
governments to publish scientific researches in a similar way,
is largely a product of the influence of the Institution?</p>

<p>One of the main features of the Institution in its early days
was its library. Its publications were distributed throughout
the world to every scientific and literary institution of good repute,
and in exchange they sent their own publications. In
this way an immense collection of scientific periodicals and
journals was received, and the Smithsonian library became
one of the most extensive in the world in this department.
Books came in freely from other quarters and the support of
the library became a great burden to the Smithson fund. The
same policy which led to the abandonment of the Smithsonian
cabinet, led to a transfer of the library, and in 1866 the books
were transferred to the Capitol where they are cared for as a
section of the national library under the name of “The Smithsonian
Deposit.” The books come in as heretofore, in exchange
and as donations, and are sent weekly to their place of
custody at the other end of the mall. The increase in 1883
amounted to 11,739 books and pamphlets, and the total deposit
amounts to about 100,000 volumes. Several thousand
volumes are retained in the working libraries of the Institution.</p>

<p>At the time of the Smithson bequest the endowment of research
had scarcely been attempted in America. There were
schools and colleges in which science was taught and certain
of the professors employed in these institutions were engaged
in original investigation. There were a few young and struggling
scientific societies, the American Academy of Sciences in
Boston, and the Boston Society of Natural History, the Connecticut
Academy of Sciences, the New York Lyceum of Natural
History (now the New York Academy of Sciences), the
American Philosophical Society, and the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia. The American Association for the
Advancement of Science was not organized until 1840. The
publications of these societies were necessarily very limited
in extent and influence, but then together with the monthly
journal published at New Haven, by Professor Silliman, they
embodied the chief outcome of American scientific work.
Science in America was an infant in swaddling clothes. Forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
years have passed and American science now stands by the
side of the science of Britain, of Germany, of France, a fellow
worker, competing on an equal footing in nearly every field of
research. No one is likely to question the statement that the
Smithsonian Institution has done what was absolutely indispensable
to the rapid and symmetrical development of American
scientific institutions, and it is equally certain that the
progress of American science has had an immense influence
upon the welfare of America in every department of intellectual
and industrial activity. It has offered a helping hand to every
institution and every individual in America capable of profiting
by its generous aid, and has stimulated coöperation by
them with similar workers abroad. In this way its influence
has been enormous, but still greater has been the benefit of its
stimulating powers upon the policy of the general government
toward scientific ends.</p>

of one who has well been called ‘the model of a Christian gentleman,’ and
who is also our best example of a physical philosopher. His life was the practical
harmony of the two characters. His entire freedom from the doubts which disturb
some minds is shown in that last letter which he dictated, in which he touches the
grounds of faith, both in natural and revealed religion; also in his sententious declaration
upon some earlier occasions, that the person who thought there could be any
real conflict between science and religion must be either very young in science or
very ignorant of religion.”</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now when the cheerless empire of the sky</div>
<div class="verse i1">To Capricorn the Centaur Archer yields,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But as the days go by, his rays no longer struggle “through
the thick air” in “horizontal lines,” nor does he so closely
“skirt the southern sky,” but higher mounting pierces with
penetrating power the dark shadows, lessening “the long,
dark night,” driving “the dusky shades away.” So rapidly
do these changes occur that in four weeks our daylight increases
one hour and seven minutes, or our length of days
from ten hours and nine minutes on the 1st to eleven
hours sixteen minutes on the 28th. On the 1st, 16th and 28th
the sun rises at 7:09, 6:52 and 6:34 a. m., and on the same days
sets at 5:18, 5:36 and 5:50 p. m. respectively.</p>

<h3>THE MOON</h3>

<p class="unindent">Presents us with great regularity her changes: Last quarter
on the 6th at 5:29 p. m.; new, on the 14th, at 9:13 p. m.; first
quarter, on the 22d, at 5:23 a. m.; and full on the 28th, at 10:52
p. m. In apogee (farthest from earth) on the 9th, at 7:24 p. m.;
in perigee (nearest the earth) on the 25th, at 6:24 p. m. Least
elevation, 10th, amounting to 30° 9´; greatest elevation, 24th,
equal to 66° 45´.</p>

<h3>MERCURY,</h3>

<p class="unindent">“The fleet-footed,” makes a direct motion of 43° 18´ 37´´,
moving from about the middle of the constellation <i>Sagittarius</i>
and through <i>Capricornus</i>, and is the companion of Venus
throughout the month (see “Venus”). Rises on the 1st at 5:55
a. m., and sets at 3:13 p. m.; on the 16th, rises at 6:12 a. m.,
sets at 3:50 p. m.; on the 28th, rises at 6:22 a. m., sets at 4:46
p. m. On the 11th, at 7:00 p. m., is 44´ south of Venus; on
the 12th, at 4:00 a. m., farthest from the sun; on the 13th, at
5:42 a. m., 5° 56´ south of the moon.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">And Mercury are both morning stars during the entire month,
and are so intimately connected as to afford a fine opportunity
for making the acquaintance of the latter. On the 1st Venus
is about one and a half degrees east and 1´ 38´´ north of Mercury;
but as Mercury moves more rapidly than Venus, he will
overtake and pass her on the evening of the 11th at a point
44´ south; on the 22d, he will cross her orbit to the north, and
at a distance of 3½° east; and on the 28th will be found nearly
6° east and 53´ north of her. Before the 11th Mercury will rise
earlier than Venus; on the 11th they will practically rise at the
same time; after the 11th Mercury will rise later than Venus.
On the 1st Venus rises at 6:00 a. m.; on the 16th, at 6:05 a. m.;
and on the 28th, at 6:03 a. m. She sets on the corresponding
days at 3:18, 3:51 and 4:19 p. m. respectively. Her motion is
direct and amounts to 35° 54´ 10´´; on the 13th, at 5:18 a m.,
she is 5° 9´ south of the moon. Her diameter decreases from
11.2´´ on the 1st to 10.6´´ on the 28th.</p>

<h3>MARS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will during this month be both evening and morning star,
changing his relation on the 11th, on which date he will be in
conjunction with the sun, and will not be visible to the naked
eye. His motion will amount to 21° 25´ 32´´ direct, and his
diameter remain at 4.2´´. On the 14th, at 10:44 p. m., he will
be 4° 30´ south of the moon; on the 28th, at 2:00 p. m., in perihelion,
or nearest the sun. On the 1st he will rise at 7:26 a. m.
and set at 5:22 p. m.; on the 16th, rise at 6:58 a. m., set at 5:24
p. m.; on the 28th, rise at 6:35 a. m., set at 5:25 p. m.</p>

<h3>JUPITER</h3>

<p class="unindent">Rises on the 1st at 6:48 p. m., and sets on the 2d at 8:06 a. m.;
rises on the 15th at 5:48 p. m., sets at 7:12 a. m. on the 16th;
rises at 5:47 p. m. on the 28th and sets the next day at 5:17 a.
m. On the 1st, at 2:07 a. m., he is 4° 9´ north of the moon; on
the 19th, at 2:00 a. m., in opposition to the sun, that is, on the
opposite side of the sun from the earth; on the 28th, at 6:43 a.
m., he is again in conjunction with the moon, being 4° 27´
north of our satellite. During the month his diameter increases
two-tenths of a second, and he has a retrograde motion
of 3° 24´ 8´´. The statement that Jupiter retrogrades some 3½°
may puzzle some of our younger readers, who have doubtless
been instructed in what is a fact, that not one of our planets
has a retrograde motion; but that all move from west to east
about the sun as a center. What we mean by retrograde is
really only <i>apparent</i> retrograde; and it was something very
puzzling to the early astronomers, particularly to those who
thought that the earth and not the sun was the center of our
system; that the sun and all the heavenly bodies revolved
each day about our earth. When it was discovered that the
earth revolved each day on its axis, and all the planets revolved
about the sun, the retrograde motions were <i>comparatively</i>
easy to understand. Let us see if we can obtain a clear
idea of Jupiter’s actions for this month. As we view him on
the night of the 1st he appears about five degrees <i>east</i> and 1°
2´ south of the bright star <i>Regulus</i>, which can be seen almost
the entire night as the brightest of the six stars forming the
sickle in the constellation <i>Leo</i>. Noting his position again on
the night of the 28th, we find that he has moved westward
about 3½°, and is only about 1½° <i>east</i> and 17´ north of Regulus;
thus, as we say, having retrograded about 3½°. To assist
us in understanding this, let us take an orange to represent
the sun, a grain (of mustard, for example) to represent the
earth, a pea to represent Jupiter, and a point of some kind for
Regulus. Now place these objects on a stand in the following
order: In one line, at the beginning, the orange; two inches
distant, the grain; eight inches farther, the pea. Next draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
a line through the center of the orange so as to make an angle
of five degrees with the line through the orange, grain and
pea, and at as great a distance as convenient, stick a pin to
represent Regulus. Now move the grain and pea (the former
about two and one-fourth times as fast as the latter) about the
orange as a center, in the direction of the movement of the
hands of the clock (that is, from left to right). We can readily
see that on account of the more rapid motion of the grain, together
with its being nearer the orange, that the pea will <i>fall
behind</i>; and if we sight along the line of the grain and pea,
the latter will be seen nearer the line joining the orange and
the pin; and should we continue the moving of the grain and
pea, making similar observations, we should find the pea approaching
nearer and nearer, and perhaps even passing the
line through the orange and pin. These relative motions we
can see will continue until the grain makes nearly one-fourth
of a circumference, after which the pea appears to make a
movement in exactly the opposite direction. Now the foregoing
represents tolerably well the relative positions and movements
for this month of the bodies named. The earth, Jupiter
and Regulus are on the same side of the sun; the earth nearest,
Jupiter next (about five times as far as the earth), and
Regulus next (at a distance of say 20,000,000,000,000 miles),
and five degrees west of the line joining the earth and Jupiter.
(These bodies we know move at the average rate of 18.38 and
8.06 miles per second respectively.) Our standpoint is the
earth, and as we move eastwardly so much more rapidly than
Jupiter, we find him dropping back each day, and apparently
approaching nearer to Regulus, till at the end of the month we
find him as before stated, only about 1½° <i>east</i> of that star.
Should we watch him through March and April, we should
find him retrograding during the former month and twenty-two
days of the latter, on the 23d of April being 1½° <i>west</i> of Regulus;
and on the same date, as the earth would be going directly
away from him, he would appear stationary; and immediately
afterward would seem to start again toward the east.
Jupiter, as we know, is one of the superior planets, and an explanation
of his retrograde motion explains that of all the others
of his kind. A little ingenuity, putting the earth for Jupiter
and Mercury or Venus for the earth, will show what is meant
by the retrograde motion of the inferior planets.</p>

<h3>SATURN</h3>

<p class="unindent">Rises at 12:58 p. m. on the 1st and sets at 3:34 a. m. on the 2d;
rises at 11:58 a. m. on the 16th and sets at 2:35 a. m. on the
17th; rises at 11:12 a. m. on the 28th and sets at 1:48 a. m. on
March 1st. On the 16th, at 4:00 a. m., stationary; on 23d, at
3:21 a. m., 3° 44´ north of the moon. Diameter diminishes one
second. Will be an evening star during the entire month, and
thus afford most convenient opportunities for observations.</p>

<h3>URANUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Has a retrograde motion of 49´ 53´´; diameter, 3.8´´. On the
3d, at 3:25 a. m., is 1° 7´ north of the moon; on the 31st of January
it rises at 9:25 p. m. and sets on the 1st at 9:23 a. m.; on
the 15th, rises at 8:24 p. m. and sets on the 16th at 8:22 a. m.;
rises on the 27th at 7:35 p. m. and sets on the 28th at 7:35 a. m.
It is now a little south of the equator, in the constellation <i>Virgo</i>,
and will remain in that constellation some six years.</p>

<h3>NEPTUNE</h3>

<p class="unindent">Is only mentioned, lest the omission of his name might be regarded
as a “slight.” He is a slow-goer, and, except that his
presence confirms a law, we hardly know what he was created
for. However, his habits are quite regular; and we note that
he takes the <i>rôle</i> of evening star, setting on the 2d at 1:22 a.
m.; on the 17th, at 12:23 a. m., and on the 28th, at 11:37 p. m.
Has a direct motion of 14´ 35´´; a diameter of 2.6´´; and on
the 8th, at 9:00 p. m., is 90° east of the sun.</p>

<p>New Orleans is our most pleasing American city to persons
from a northern climate. Florida presents no place important
enough to illustrate a large general society. Texas has rising
towns, but the Anglo-Saxon domination there brings them
more and more into resemblance to our own settled English,
or rather, British communities. In San Francisco we are
charmed not only with a complete change of foliage, scenery,
and climate, but with unexpected varieties in the population,
there being a little tinge of the south of Europe as well as of
Mexico and of the Celestial Kingdom in the speculative yet
placid elements there. Yet New Orleans is not so hard as even
San Francisco. It is a land not merely of fruit, but of the sugar-cane.
It lies on that warm gulf whose farther shores were
more historical three hundred years ago than now. As time
advances and we complete our own connections and general
developments we see more and more that the American destiny
must be southward. Canada, which has had a much
longer history than the United States, presents even now but a
thin rim of settlement, and her entire population from the
banks of Newfoundland to Vancouver’s Island is not equal
to that of the single state of New York. On the other hand,
Mexico, through which the Americans have built costly railroad
systems piercing to the very capital city, has a population
certainly twice that of Canada, and probably three times the
number, considering the extension of Mexico toward Central
America. American diplomacy has little other ground to cover
for the near future, than the republics to the south of us. The
surfeit of enterprises and of productions in the United States
compels us to consider a time when we must not only find markets
in the Spanish American states, but shall become, if not
pioneers, as we once were, certainly competitors in the Pacific
Ocean, of the English, Germans, and other modern nations.
We have opened a way to the Pacific by railroad, but the canal
long contemplated across Central America will operate more
impartially toward shippers, will cheapen the movement of
goods, and incline the United States rapidly toward an understanding
of the new peoples to our southwest, in methods no
doubt providentially designed. New Orleans has been so
clearly understood by our railroad magnates that they have
hastened, almost without public assistance, to connect her not
only with great points like Hampton Roads, Richmond, Cincinnati
and Chicago, but the railroads are finished from San
Francisco to New Orleans, and the only continental railroad
system from ocean to ocean under a single management, does
not pass by Chicago, but by New Orleans. The Americans
originally stimulated by the governmental credit to build from
the Missouri River to San Francisco, have upon their own
credit and earnings stretched a railroad through California
nearly to the gulf of that name, and then across the deserts and
Texas, until New Orleans is at this moment the Atlantic seaport
of California. Mr. Gould, who succeeded Colonel Thomas
A. Scott, has stretched another railroad system parallel to Mr.
Huntington’s from the desert through Northern Texas and
down the Red River to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Near the close of the past year another important railroad
was built from Memphis directly to New Orleans. A little earlier
last year the Cincinnati Southern Railroad was extended
directly to New Orleans by the great syndicate which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
leased it. Therefore, there now run into New Orleans four
lines of rail east of the Mississippi River, and two great lines
west of the Mississippi. Contrast this with the railroad facilities
which existed there only fourteen years ago. At that time
New Orleans had only one railroad to the north, and that had
certain connections, and was under no consolidated sway. It
was not even connected with its adjacent city of Mobile by
rail. It had no railroad facilities whatever to reach Texas,
except a little piece of road which ran to the Gulf near the
mouth of the Atchafalaya, and there found steamships for Galveston.</p>

<p>While other cities in the South have shown a cheerful energy
to revive themselves, and while new cities have started up at
many points, and have become respectable centers of trade,
New Orleans has retained all that imperial promise under freedom
which she had in the palmiest days of slavery. Perhaps
no city in the South, or in the world, has so thoroughly changed
its ideas, political and social, in spite of sharp contests for party
supremacy there.</p>

<p>The great exhibition of the present year is the best instance
that New Orleans means to lead the industrial spirit of the
South, and to become no longer the great filibuster in the
tropics, but the energetic merchant and projector there. No
lawless impulse guided the erection of the great buildings
which are now crowded with the productions of America and
Mexico.</p>

<p>The attempt to let the sugar interests of Louisiana and Mississippi
go in favor of the productions of Cuba and the East
Indies, distinctly points the people at the mouth of the Mississippi
to the fact that their alliance is probably to be with the
Northern states, not merely in politics, but in commerce.</p>

<p>New Orleans is not the only French city in the United States,
but it is the only one which preserves the French quality and
language perfectly, and in that respect resembles Montreal and
Quebec. St. Louis had a French and Spanish basis, but when
that post became American the small Latin element was compelled,
in self-defense, to adopt the language and living of the
Anglo-Saxons. New Orleans, however, had a sufficient start
when the Americans occupied it in 1803, to grow relatively
with the American settlers and consequently two cities arose
side by side, which still preserve their differences as much as
if a quarter of London and a quarter of Paris had been cut out
and united. Besides, there was a large rural and planting
element in Louisiana, of the French stock, which has assisted
to keep up the French infusion, and hence the market at New
Orleans is the most characteristic thing in the city, where the
<i>habitants</i> and the hucksters, the fishers from the Gulf, and the
porters and carters, carry us back to a scene anterior to the
France of to-day, or before republican ideas had reached the
far French colonies. New Orleans, too, constantly received
emigration from neighboring French and Spanish islands and
coasts as they were affected by negro insurrections, or by internal
revolutions. Naturally the fleeing planters from Hayti
and the Lesser Antilles made their way to the nearest large
town, and the steam shipping of the Gulf all concentrates at
the two centers of the ellipse, New Orleans and Havana. The
Mississippi River, which is the only river of the first class on
the globe to pass through a cultivated land and an enlightened
population, sufficiently marks New Orleans as the eye of its
destiny adjacent to its mouth. There are many Americans
who have never been to New Orleans, who are unaware that
it, like New York, has two distinct harbors or outlets. As New
York has Long Island Sound and the Bay of New York,
one opening a hundred miles to the east of the other, so New
Orleans has a lake system close by which gives her internal
communication far to the east, or almost to the bay of Mobile,
and saves her two hundred miles of round-about river navigation
to reach her own coasts. It may be thought that New
Orleans is too far from the mouth of the Mississippi to command
that the commerce of the Gulf should come a hundred
miles up that river for her benefit, yet Philadelphia and Baltimore
are quite as far from the ocean, and these cities have
easily commanded a great interior trade through the communications
they possessed, and from the products they had to
supply. Coal, for example, makes the most effective article
of the commerce of both Baltimore and Philadelphia, and coal
is more valuable in the Gulf because farther from the mines,
than it is on the near east coast. The coal furnished to the
shipping at New Orleans has descended the entire line of the
river, yet by such easy facilities that at New Orleans it is
probably the cheapest coal in the world for the distance it has to
come to get a market. Great floats, of which dozens are hauled
by a small tug or tow boat, go down the Ohio to its mouth, and
pass on to New Orleans and are there so easily discharged that
the lumber in them finds a market with the coal.</p>

<p>Besides, the railroad projectors, without other inducement
than their own sagacity, have concurred in running all their
railroads to New Orleans, for the country at the mouth of the
Mississippi is neither so healthy nor so strategical for trade as
this old town which was founded by the French under the direction
of their government when they picked slowly and carefully
the sites of future trade and military empire. These
same French located St. Louis, and it has not been found advisable
by any succeeding generation to try a better situation.</p>

<p>We may ask whether New Orleans has as great an antiquity
as our own English cities? It is not as old as Philadelphia by
almost thirty years, and is somewhat younger than Charleston,
and is about fifteen years older than Savannah. Of course it
does not compare in antiquity with the colonial cities of the
northeast, such as New York, Albany, Boston, Montreal and
Quebec. But it is nearly a century older than any of our important
Anglo-Teuton cities of the West. It is more than half
a century older than Cincinnati, and we may almost call it a
century older than Chicago. St. Louis was its Albany, or upstream
neighbor, and was under the same political domination.
Mobile was the parent place the French established on
the Gulf, and Governor Bienville made New Orleans his capital
as late as 1723, or about nine years before the birth of
General Washington.</p>

<p>Soon after this a levee was built in front of the new town,
and the early French authors and novelists took pleasure in
visiting it, and even at that date they called it “the famous
place.” As in Quebec and Montreal, the early French settlement
was almost simultaneous with the bringing out of monks
and nuns, and soon a cathedral was conceived and nunneries
were built. The French, however, had not the vigorous nature
of the English in founding new places, and after nearly
half a century of occupation there were hardly three thousand
persons in it to transfer to the Spanish who took possession of
the place in the midst of a revolution, and had some of the
best French citizens shot in order to be a terror to what the
Spanish governor, O’Reilly, already suspected to exist in
French Louisiana, the spirit of independence, which Spain
wanted to extirpate in all her colonies, fearing that they would
speedily rise to importance and overwhelm the parent power.
Spain had been dismembered by a treaty early in the eighteenth
century, and was left with enormous American possessions,
and with a very small Spain to handle them. The Spanish
cabinet then conceived the policy of preventing the growth
of the colonies, so as to keep them down, use them merely for
trade, and not let that spirit of municipal independence which
makes great fermentations in states commence anywhere.
Some of the Spanish governors, however, ordered public buildings
to be constructed, and the American residents at New
Orleans say that the Spanish sway of about forty years has
left better monuments than the French.</p>

<p>A Spanish infusion of settlers marks the present population,
and the Americans call all the Latin races, no matter whether
they come from France and her islands, or Spain and her
coasts, by the name of Creoles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious feature of New Orleans is the existence of considerable
elements there from states as foreign to ourselves as
Yucatan.</p>

<p>At the close of the American Revolution there were less than
five thousand persons in New Orleans. During that Revolution
a considerable number of respectable British settlers who
wanted to avoid the War of Independence, settled in West
Florida and about Natchez, and in other spots contiguous to
New Orleans. Hence the Revolution was hardly over before
the first chapter of manifest destiny was directed from Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Kentucky upon the opening of the Mississippi
River. That physical achievement was so important to
the producers on the Ohio and the Tennessee Rivers that
schemes of every sort were tried to hasten the opening of commerce
to the Gulf. One Senator of the United States was expelled
from his place for an intrigue partaking of the nature
of treason with the British who still backed up the Spanish on
the Gulf; and a Vice President was actually pursued nearly to
the Gulf and brought back and tried for treason at Richmond.
How long the United States might have had to wait the slow
course of diplomacy or the rough chance of war to get New
Orleans, is uncertain, but Napoleon, who had acquired Louisiana
by his mastery over Spain, believing that he could not
hold it against the English fleets, made haste to sell it to the
Americans for a sum of money and old commercial claims.</p>

<p>Eighty-two years ago, or about the rounded lifetime of an
old man, the Americans occupied New Orleans, and much of
the city burnt up the year our forefathers were voting for the
first President of the United States. A French newspaper had
been issued in New Orleans several years before the American
possession. There were perhaps eight thousand persons in
the city when it was transferred to us. Twelve years after the
transfer, the Americans under General Jackson had to give
battle to hold the city, which the English attacked with the
best troops they had used in Spain against Napoleon who had
already fallen. Napoleon was contemplating his last endeavor
to astonish the world at Waterloo, when the English and
Americans, unconscious that a treaty of peace had been made
between themselves, fought the battle of New Orleans, which
resulted in more disaster to the British arms than any battle on
land during our second conflict for independence. In St.
Paul’s Cathedral stand the monuments and statues of Packenham
and Gibbs who lost their lives in the marshes around New
Orleans.</p>

<p>In 1862, Farragut with his fleet took New Orleans. His
victory drove an entering wedge into the heart of the Confederacy
and gave to the navy of the United States a prestige
which it had never enjoyed and which in its present enfeebled
state it is rapidly losing. New Orleans was the wealthiest and
most populous city of the Confederacy; it was four times
larger than either Charleston or Richmond, and before the
war had the largest export trade of any city in the world.
Commanding mid-continental navigation and being the key to
the Gulf, its military value was equal to its commercial importance.</p>

<p>The plan for the capture of New Orleans by the navy, and
the reduction of the forts which guarded the approach to it
from the south, originated in the Navy Department in the fall
of 1861. The credit for proposing this plan has been claimed
by more persons than one, and it is likely that it was conceived
and developed from suggestions and hints received
from a variety of sources. It was determined that a naval expedition
should be sent against New Orleans. The plan found
little favor with army officers, but the President became interested
in it and Secretary Welles set about carrying it into effect.
The attention of military men was concentrated on a
proposed combination of the forces of the army and the navy
for the capture of New Orleans, in an expedition which was to
descend to the city from the upper waters of the Mississippi
River. This scheme seemed more attractive, and the idea of
taking New Orleans by means of a fleet advancing from the
Gulf had never been entertained in military circles. When
Stanton became Secretary of War and was told of the proposed
naval expedition, he was astonished at the originality and audacity
of the idea and exclaimed: “An attack upon New
Orleans by the navy! I never heard of it! It is the best news
you could give me.” Secretary Stanton entered cordially into
the spirit of the project and increased the number of the troops
which General McClelland had promised, from ten thousand to
eighteen thousand. Shortly after this, General B. F. Butler
was made acquainted with the purpose of Secretary Welles
and he was given the command of the military force which was
to hold New Orleans after the fleet had taken it. There is no
evidence that General Butler suggested any of the important
plans or details for the expedition or that he had any definite
plans concerning it.</p>

<p>Congress had ordered the blockade of 3,500 miles of coast
line. There were scarcely ships enough to maintain it, and
the vessels for the New Orleans expedition had to be built or
procured from other sources. After the Secretary of the Navy
had decided to send a fleet against New Orleans and had given
orders for the construction of it, the most serious question
which presented itself was the selection of a commander. All
of the naval officers of high rank were suggested and considered.
It was to be the most powerful and splendid fleet ever
gathered under the stars and stripes, and the Department
moved cautiously in the matter of choosing a leader for it.
Finally the name of David Glasgow Farragut was proposed.
The Secretary of the Navy remembered that years before in
the war with Mexico, Farragut had offered a daring plan for
the capture of the strong fort of San Juan de Ulloa, at Vera
Cruz. He proposed that the fort be “boarded” by attaching
long ladders to the masts of the attacking ships, which should
then be towed up to the walls of the fort. Secretary Welles
was impressed at the time with the boldness and dash of the
scheme, and though he had not seen Farragut since that day,
and really knew very little of him, yet after some consultation
he decided to offer him the command of the fleet. Farragut,
who had never had a squadron, gladly accepted the honor and
the responsibility. He had been trained by a life of study and
active service for some great emergency like this, which came
late in life, in his sixty-second year, but he was prepared for
it and he knew it. Farragut adopted the plans which had been
considered by the Navy Department and made them his own.
He grasped the work before him with a degree of earnestness
and enthusiasm unusual in men of his age. Secretary Welles
says of him at that time: “In every particular he came up to
all that was expected or required of him. He determined to
pass the forts and restore New Orleans. He might not come
back, he said, but the city would be ours.” After his arrival
at Ship Island on the 25th of March, 1862, Farragut wrote: “I
have now attained what I have been looking for all my life—a
flag—and having attained it, all that is necessary to complete
the scene is a victory. If I die in the attempt it will only be
what every officer has to expect. He who dies in doing his
duty to his country and at peace with his God, has played out
the drama of life to the best advantage.” Here was a genuine
pious hero of the old school, determined to do or to die. His task
was a herculean one. New Orleans was defended by two forts
erected at the lowest favorable point for the location of military
works, above the Gulf. Fort St. Philip occupied the left
bank of the river, and a short distance below it on the right
bank stood Fort Jackson. These forts mounted in all one hundred
and fifteen guns. A fort on the site of Jackson in 1815 held
the British fleet in check for nine days. The rebel forts were
garrisoned by 1,500 men commanded by General J. K. Duncan.
A short distance above the forts lay fifteen rebel vessels. This
fleet included the iron ram “Manassas” and a great floating
battery clad with railroad iron. Below the forts a heavy chain
supported by the hulks of eight dismasted ships obstructed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
river. Farragut was to break through the chain, fight his way
by the forts, destroy or capture the rebel fleet and then steam
up to New Orleans and place that city under his guns. The
attack was commenced by the mortar fleet. For six days the
mortars poured a ceaseless fire of shells into the fort. The
shells were flying through the air at all times; nearly six thousand
were thrown, but the forts were damaged very little and
the Confederate loss was only fourteen killed and thirty-nine
wounded. It was determined to pass the forts on April 24th.
At sunset on the 23d there were indications of the approaching
conflict on every ship in Farragut’s fleet. The attack was to
be made under cover of darkness. At eleven o’clock that
night an officer signaled that an opening which had been
made in the chain was still clear. Five minutes before two
o’clock in the morning two red lights were displayed from the
peak of the flag ship. It was the signal to steam up the river.
In about one hour the fleet of seventeen vessels, in three divisions,
was moving. The moon was rising, but its light was
lost in the fierce flames from bonfires and fire rafts. Both forts
opened fire upon the first ship as she passed through the row
of hulks. Five minutes later the little “Cayuga” was pouring
grape and canister into Fort St. Philip, and in ten minutes more
she had passed from the range of its guns and was in the arms
of the rebel fleet. It was a lively moment for the brave little
boat. Eleven rebel gunboats tried to demolish her at once.
She could not go forward, she would not go backward. There
was nothing to do but to close with the enemy. She drove an
“eleven inch” shot through one of her antagonists and it ran
aground and burned up. Another one was crippled by a well
directed shot, and the “Cayuga” was about to grapple with the
third when two ships of the Union fleet came to her aid, the
“Oneida” and the “Varuna.”</p>

<p>The former ran into one of the rebel ships and almost cut her
in twain. The “Varuna” was rammed by the “Manassas” and
another ship and went to the bottom in fifteen minutes. While
she was going down she fired into one of her adversaries and
so damaged her that she had to surrender to the “Oneida,” and
she sent a shell into another rebel gunboat which exploded its
boiler. All the time the remaining vessels of the first division
were steaming by the forts, pouring tremendous volleys into
them and receiving tremendous discharges in return. Farragut’s
flag ship, the “Hartford,” led the second division of the
fleet. She was a noble vessel, splendidly equipped; she
steamed into the fight and was followed by the long line of
ships in the second and third divisions. By this hour day was
dawning, but heavy clouds of smoke hung over the river and
no light from the east reached the battling ships. The cannonading
which all along had been terrific was now growing sublime.
Three hundred heavily shotted guns were flashing and
roaring over the dark water. The Union ships advanced to
the fray like the famous “Light Brigade,” with cannon to the
right of them, to the left of them and before them. Probably
it was the most picturesque naval battle in the world’s history.
Thirty-four armed vessels and two great forts were struggling
in the early morning. The sun seemed to stand still in the
heavens. The light of the guns was brighter than the orb of
day, and Farragut’s gunners had to aim at the cannon flashes
from the rebel forts. The forts themselves were not visible.
The vessels of the enemy were not visible. Our ships were
striking great blows in the dark and they always struck with
deadly effect. From points above the rebels pushed great fire
barges loaded with blazing pitch and cotton into the stream.
These rafts came floating down and when they did not ignite our
ships they illuminated them for the Confederate marksmen. A
flaming fire raft was hurled against the “Hartford” and flames
ran from the water’s edge to the mast top. The well trained crew
extinguished the fire and within five minutes the “Hartford”
destroyed a rebel steamer filled with boarding parties. The
“Brooklyn,” another Union ship, encountered a fire raft and for
a time lay helpless before the merciless guns of Fort Jackson.
Disentangling herself, she steamed up to the fort and poured
such withering broadsides into it that its guns were silenced
for a time, and the gunners were seen by the ship’s crew as
they peered through the cannon-lighted portholes, to be fleeing
from their guns. At this time the vessels which had passed
the forts were doing good work, and the stream was filled with
wrecked and burning Confederate gunboats. Fire rafts and
wrecks came drifting down side by side, and frequently one of
the latter would explode with a loud report. The low, curved
iron rams glided about like gigantic serpents of the sea.
Boarding parties were overrunning some vessels and being repulsed
from others. It was an awful, dazzling and furiously
shifting panorama. The last ship to pass the forts on that memorable
morning was the “Penola.” In the light of a blazing raft
she received the discharge of the forty guns of St. Philip, and
passed on to join the victorious fleet above. “And thus,” says
Farragut’s son, “was accomplished a feat in naval warfare
which had no precedent, and which is still without a parallel
except the one furnished by Farragut himself two years later
at Mobile.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the next day the fleet moved up to New
Orleans. At noon Captain Bailey was sent to demand of the
mayor of the city its unconditional surrender, and that the flag
of Louisiana be removed from the City Hall. The mayor refused
to haul down the flag or to make a formal surrender of
the city. While the officers and men of the fleet were attending
divine service the next day, they were startled by the discharge
of a howitzer from the main mast of the “Pensacola.”
The watchman in the rigging had seen four men tear down the
flag of the Union from the roof of the mint, and had at once
fired the gun which was trained on the flag staff.</p>

<p>On the 28th the forts surrendered to Commander Porter, who
had been pounding away at them with his mortars. May 1st,
General Butler and his troops entered New Orleans, and Farragut
turned the city over to him. His administration was
vigorous, but was hateful to the citizens. He hanged Mumford,
the leader of the mob which tore the Union flag from the
mint; he issued his celebrated woman order which placed
every female who insulted a Union soldier on the level of the
street walker; he treated with severity a Mrs. Phillips, who
jeered at the remains of a Union soldier. He is condemned
for all of these things by very many people. Many dishonest
things were done during his administration, but repose, vigor
and security were the characteristics of it. General Butler
was a just, efficient, straightforward tyrant, not cruel, but possessed
of an inflexible determination to make his will the law
and to make his cause succeed. After General Butler came
General Banks. He endeavored to restore loyalty to the state
by good treatment, but fell into the error of reposing trust in a
type of men who could not understand freedom nor adopt
even a business patriotism for the sake of their own prosperity.</p>

<p>By the census of 1880 New Orleans showed for three-quarters
of a century of American rule a population of 216,000 people,
of whom 175,000 are natives of the United States, and only
58,000 are colored people. New Orleans stood the tenth of
American cities, with more than 36,000 houses, and more than
45,000 families. Although the manufactures of New Orleans
were in their infancy they had an annual product of nineteen
million dollars, and paid nearly four million dollars a year
wages. Looking over the list of states to discover the origin
of the people of New Orleans, the remarkable fact appears
that of her 216,000 people more then 151,000 are natives of
Louisiana. The neighboring state of Mississippi has not put
thirty-eight hundred souls into New Orleans. Alabama, which
is within two or three hours’ ride by cars, has not two thousand
native children in New Orleans, but New York has over two
thousand of her progeny settled in New Orleans, and Virginia
has 4,300. Of the 41,000 foreign population, nearly 7,000 are
natives of France, showing that there is a constant immigration,
as in the days of Bienville, from old France to new France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Germany has contributed to New Orleans 14,000 emigrants.
About the same number have come to New Orleans from Great
Britain and Ireland. Spain has contributed about 800 of her
natives, Italy about 2,000, Switzerland nearly 500, Mexico only
300, and the West Indies scarcely 400. These are suggestive
figures, and show that since the great rebellion those elements
go to the far South which have the most original emigrating
spirit and the greater variety of self-sustaining trades and pursuits.
A man who can do nothing, make nothing, improve
nothing, has the least of all motives to emigrate. The debt
of New Orleans was about seventeen million dollars at the last
advices, considerably less than the debts of Baltimore and
Washington, but some four millions more than the debt of
Chicago. Railroads and other municipal improvements were
responsible for a good deal of this debt.</p>

<p>Since the war New Orleans has been transformed from the likeness
of a quiet old French city like Orleans which gave it name,
to the appearance of a new French city with pretty relics here
and there, and strong cosmopolitan attachments. The great
river which sweeps in splendid curves past this city has compelled
the streets to conform to some extent to its shores, but
the consequence is a charming disposition of streets to both
those who hate crooked streets, and those who hate straight
ones. The town may be likened to the spokes of a wheel with
streets laid out between the spokes in both directions, and conforming
to them to some extent. In front of the city stretches
the great bank called the levee, at the foot of which ride the
majestic steamers which come from all portions of the Mississippi
valley and are often like palaces in cardboard, and since
the jetties have been made a success by Captain Eads and the
United States engineers, you also see at New Orleans, riding
cosily, the huge steamships from New York, Liverpool and
Cuba. The chief maritime lines from New York to Texas now
stop at New Orleans and the journey is continued by rail.
This great levee, which is an artificial hill thrown up to keep
the river back, is lined with the sugar hogsheads and cotton
bales of the South, with coal and iron, plows and stoves, kegs
of nails, merchandise assembled from all parts of the globe,
and massive presses driven by steam to further compress
the bales of cotton and reduce them in bulk for shipment. A
canal runs through the city, and its other termination is on
Lake Pontchartrain. At the lake is a beautiful new resort
built in recent years, nearly as agreeable as Chautauqua Lake,
and the peculiar Creole and negro cooking of New Orleans is
to be found in perfection there, as well as at the Spanish fort,
in the environs of the city. The shops of New Orleans are
open to the air all winter long, and art of a local nature is
taking root there. Whatever the Gulf produces is to be seen
at the Creole capital, and a visit to it for even a few days is
the next thing to a trip to Europe.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There is a Chautauqua further on. First, there is a lake
level, and just above it is the level of the “Point,” with its
pleasant grass, its winding walks, its old Auditorium, shaded
and hallowed with memories that have grown through multiplying
years. The old cottages, and many of the old cottagers
remain about this Auditorium—reminders of the old times,
and the oldest times, of Chautauqua, when the first vesper service
announced that “The Day Goeth Away,” and the “Nearer
My God to Thee,” rang out under these forest arches. Who
that was there can ever forget that hour? The altars were
aglow that night, and hearts on fire. It was an experiment,
but from the first it was an assured success. The time will
come when the remaining sharers in that first feast in the evening
light will be very few, and the last of them will receive
honor, and the children of Chautauqua will listen to their story
as with quivering lips and kindling eye they speak about that
first evening under the trees, the words that broke the sacred
silence, the songs that bore praise and wonder and joy to the
heavens, and the friendships that were formed there never to
be broken.</p>

<p>How many who joined in the first Chautauqua service have
already “fallen on sleep” and gone out into a world sleepless
and without nightfall, where, for vesper chant are substituted
the hallelujahs of an eternal morning.</p>

<p>But let us go up higher. Beyond the Point and Auditorium
level are the terraces that run along the hillside, one above
another, gardens and cottages, with pathways and winding
roads, leading up under welcome shadows to a higher Chautauqua—a
long stretch of table-land crowned now with Temple
and Chapel, Pyramid, Museum and Hall of Philosophy,
while beyond, in the open fields toward the north we reach the
highest point of our Assembly grounds, one of the highest on
the lake. Thus from the landing and the beginning of our
journey we ascend from the lowest to the highest, and find
beauty, delight, pleasant welcomes and rewards all the way.</p>

<p>This study in the lay of the land which makes the physical
Chautauqua is an allegory. There is an upper Chautauqua.
And not all who visit the place see it, and not all who become
Chautauquans reach it.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua movement is progressive, and its friends
and students are expected to make advancement in the line of
its conceptions and provisions. It has court beyond court in
which it unfolds its progressive aims and introduces its disciples
to the higher privileges of culture which it provides. No
fences or lines mark these successive stages. They do not
correspond with the topographical elevations, although we
have found in the one a figure or symbol of the other. But
such gradation exists, and I shall point it out.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Assembly</span>—Is the first point of approach to the true
Chautauqua. It is the outer court open to the whole world. It
has no restraints upon those who come, save those which are
necessary to guarantee a financial support to the institution,
and those rules of ordinary decorum which are essential to the
quiet enjoyment and profit of those who pay their tribute and
wait for the promised compensation. And this compensation
comes in lectures on the widest range of topics, from the “Philosophy
of Locke and Berkeley” to the light and cheery discussions
about “Fools and their Folly.” Concerts by gifted
artists, characterizations by rare impersonators, illustrations of
life and manners in remote regions, by the aid of costumer
and <i>tableaux vivants</i>, stories of travel, with photographic accompaniments
colored, magnified, and illuminated; sermons
by able ministers, lessons by competent teachers, attractions
for lighthearted youth and wearied but rational age, in bonfires,
processions, fireworks, illuminated fleets—these are the features
of the outer court of Chautauqua for the entertainment,
awakening, and broadening of people who come with no far-reaching
or serious purpose, but who come to “hear” and
“see” and have “a good time.” They are simply recipients.
The will-power lies dormant, save as some stirring statement
of lecture or sermon, or some unsyllabled passage in music
opens the soul to the worlds all about it replete with marvel,
beauty and power. So much for the outer Chautauqua. There
are those who see this—only this and nothing more. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
come and go. They wonder why they and others come, and
yet they think they may come again—but are not sure. They
do not forget Chautauqua, and they do not “go wild” over
it. They smile at other people, whom they call “fanatics,” because
they are full of it, and “bound to come again,” and to
“come every year,” and always, and “would be willing to
live there.” These have seen the Upper Chautauqua—for beyond
the “Assembly” is</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Circle.</span>—It is another court—further in, and a
little higher up—with a white-pillared hall among the trees—“The
Hall in the Grove,” about which a book has been written,
and in which songs are sung and weird services held, and
where strange inspirations fall on people. For those who belong
to the Circle—the “C. L. S. C.” as everybody calls it—are
advanced Chautauquans. They know why they come to
the place. And they know when to come. They keep a calendar,
and they mark the feasts, and they know what to do
when they are there. They seem at home. There are hosts
of them—all knowing each other, and apparently bound together
by some secret association which has a mystic power.
They wear badges on certain days, badges of different styles
and colors and legends. In all this there is something singular
and beautiful.</p>

<p>This “Circle” is a company of pledged readers in wide
ranges of literature. The “Assembly” contains people who
listen. The “Circle” is made up of people who read. The
“Assembly” covers a few weeks. The “Circle” casts its canopy
over the year and the years. The “Assembly” is at Chautauqua.
The “Circle” carries Chautauqua to the world’s end—to
the east and to the west, to Canada, to Florida, to Scotland,
to the Sandwich Islands, to India, and Japan, to Cape
Colony—everywhere.</p>

<p>The members of the “Circle” stand on a higher plane than the
Assembly, because they put will into the work. They read
what they ought, for months and years, everywhere, getting
larger views of the world, and worthier views of life, and nobler
views of the race, and of God the Father of all.</p>

<p>The “Circle” takes a wide sweep in the world of letters. Its
themes are those of the college world. It puts the preparatory
and college curriculums into good, readable English, and helps
people out of college to know what is going on there; what
the young people study in history, language, and literature;
what authors they read, and what estimate is to be placed on
them and their work. It gives glimpses of science, physical
and metaphysical—pointing down to the rocks and up to the
stars, and about to the fields and seas and the forms of life in
plant and animal. Whatever college boys study, the “Circle”
provides in some form and degree for parents to read, that
home and college may be one in outlook and sympathy, in aim
and delight. But there is something beyond.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Inner Circle.</span>—Beyond the readers are the students—those
who have completed the four years’ reading in the
“Circle,” and the members of the “Society of the Hall in the
Grove;” have filled out the various memoranda; have certain
seals on their C. L. S. C. diplomas, testifying to this fact, and
to the reading of the additional books. These walk on the
higher levels. Their names are enrolled in the “Order of the
White Seal.” Their faces are turned toward the Upper Chautauqua.</p>

<p>It is possible that the members of the C. L. S. C. who walk
in the inner circle may meet those who rank with them, although
they have come hither by other routes—through the
“Chautauqua Teachers’ Retreat,” the “Chautauqua Spare Minute
Courses,” and the “Chautauqua Assembly Normal
Courses.” As students, they all rejoice in the larger places of
Chautauqua. But there are heights beyond these heights.</p>

<p>“Hearers,” “readers,” “student-readers,” successively mark
the three ascending grades of the Chautauqua movement, as
outlined in the “Assembly,” the “Circle,” and the “Inner
Circle.” Beyond these three stages, we come to</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The University Circle.</span>—Here are members of “The
League of the Round Table,” whose seven seals on the C. L.
S. C. diploma entitle them to this higher honor. Here, too,
are advanced students in the “Chautauqua School of Languages;”
these walk in the outer courts and among the sacred
corridors adjoining the University itself. Chautauqua now
means more than ever to them. The towers of the University
rise above them. They ask why its doors may not open to
them, and why they may not rejoice in work, real work, with
after-tests in genuine examinations, and after-honors in diploma
and degrees.</p>

<p>Some remain in this goodly place, hearing the songs that
float down from the higher halls, enjoying converse with their
fellows of the grander degree, and encouraging other and
younger and more vigorous companions to go up and possess
the land. Others knock at the door by the upper step, and as
it opens, they enter the fifth and highest form of the Chautauqua
movement—</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">The University</span>, with its schools, colleges, and <i>academiae</i>;
its teachers and professors, its text-books and tasks, its
rigid examinations, and its promotions. Concerning the <span class="smcap">University</span>,
I shall write later on.</p>

<p>One of the most profitable half hours of the local circle evening
is that spent in general conversation on a particular topic.
It furnishes a practice which is of incalculable value. At the
same time it is not possible to put a number on a program of
which it is more difficult to make a perfect success. Of course
many circles have learned the art of talking. At <span class="smcap">Shiloh, N.
Y.</span>, the “Atlantic” circle of sixteen members, a busy, prosperous
organization, to introduce variety into their programs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
often hold a “meeting of informal conversation,” but very
many of us can not succeed. At the root of our trouble lies
that totally false idea that the ability to converse is the gift of
a few. When leaders suggest a <i>conversazione</i> the difficulties
presented seem almost insurmountable. The members contend
that they can not talk; they will not try; they urge that
while history and science make excellent studies, they are too
“heavy” for conversation; they fly the subject and intrude
a chit-chat which totally destroys serious conversation. Some
time ago we saw successfully tried in a circle of about twenty
members, the following method for cultivating conversation:
The subject was introduced by the leader in a brief and earnest
talk. He showed the barrenness of ideas and the lack of
fine and exact expression in our social converse. He urged
the possibility and the duty of every one becoming an entertaining
talker. An interest was thoroughly aroused,
and a vote was carried by the society to devote a half hour
to talking on subjects suggested by the C. L. S. C. readings.
Each member promised to confine himself to the subject, to
come prepared to follow the whole subject, and to give particular
items on certain points. Members were bound to ask
questions, to look up pictures to illustrate, anecdotes to enliven
and wise words to enforce the points brought out. They
learned to talk, and to talk on worthy subjects. Their experience
soon grew to be a little like that which happened to a
member of the <span class="smcap">Hollister, California</span>, circle. A lady
meeting her, remarked: “I am getting jealous of those Chautauquans,
for if two of them meet they can talk of nothing
but those old Greeks.” Our friends grew to talk so well that a
lady, applying for admission, said: “I want to join your society,
for it seems to me that a society which inspires so much
intelligent conversation must be very valuable.” Every circle
of the C. L. S. C. which has had experience in this work should
lend to others its ideas and suggestions. But now let us
turn to something which is much easier to chat over than are
methods for improving ourselves in conversation—our circles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nova Scotia</span> gives no hint in its report from the <span class="smcap">Halifax</span>
C. L. S. C. of the bleakness which we usually associate with
its stormy northern coast. This Halifax circle announces
itself in a flourishing condition, with a regular membership of
fifteen and with twenty or thirty regular attendants. The
growth of the work in Nova Scotia is apparent to them and
they look for an addition of many members soon. Already
the number of members in Nova Scotia is nearly double that
of last year.</p>

<p>At the extreme eastern point of <span class="smcap">Maine</span>, in the pretty village
of <span class="smcap">Lubec</span>, the “Pansies” have taken root. The busy little
“Quoddy” circle of eight members forms the nucleus around
which, we trust, will collect a future legion of as interested
members as are our present friends.——Another Pine-Tree
state town, <span class="smcap">Brownfield</span>, has a circle reading its third year’s
course. It would be difficult, they think, to find more enthusiastic
workers.——On the southern point of the beautiful
Moosehead Lake, in the town of <span class="smcap">Greenville</span>, a circle of
“Plymouth Rocks” was founded in November, 1884. The
class express increasing interest in their readings, and are confident
of a large growth in numbers during the year. The
“North Star” is the pretty name they have chosen for their
circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Hampshire</span> sends two year-old circles to our columns
this month. One from <span class="smcap">Tilton</span> reorganized last fall with
twenty-four members. They meet fortnightly and remember
all the memorial days. May their name, “Winnipisaukee,”
prove auspicious, and the “smile of the Great Spirit” be ever
with them.——The “St. Paul” circle, which was organized in
the fall of 1883, at <span class="smcap">Manchester, N. H.</span>, but not reported to
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, was reorganized last fall with a membership
of thirty-seven. They have in the circle twenty-one of the
class of ’88, while only five are of the class of ’87—a proof that
the “Chautauqua Idea” is growing in favor. They prepare
interesting programs consisting of essays, readings, talks, etc.
Also, they use the “Chautauqua Songs,” and find them a great
help.</p>

<p>The circle at <span class="smcap">Plainfield, Vermont</span>, consists of fourteen
hard working members and is in its first year. They find great
enjoyment in their reading. Last November, the loss by death
of one of their most active and loved members, Mrs. F. A.
Drinell, threw a shadow over their circle, but they have persisted
in their work.——To the numbers of pretty programs
which have come to our table has been added a neatly painted
one from <span class="smcap">Rutland, Vt.</span>, a souvenir of the Milton Memorial Reception
held by the “Alpha” branch of the C. L. S. C. This
entertainment was very highly complimented by the local press.</p>

<p>A member of the “Mizpah” circle of <span class="smcap">New Bedford, Mass.</span>,
pays a very high compliment to the character of that circle’s
work. He writes that he has learned more of Greek history
and literature in the four meetings which their circle had held
when he wrote, than in all the time he gave last year to solitary
study. Certainly the circle must be accomplishing its design
of doing “solid work.” Nor are their numbers, though
but six, a drawback. A small circle, if perfectly congenial, has
some strong advantages.——Last month <span class="smcap">East Weymouth,
Mass.</span>, reported the circle which has had such a vigorous
growth this year. Now we hear of a new circle in the sister
city of <span class="smcap">South Weymouth</span>, and very soon we may hope to do
something more than formally introduce our new friend.——The
“Parker Hill” local circle, of <span class="smcap">Boston</span>, organized in September,
1883, has become so much interested in the circles
which month after month send their greetings and their suggestions
to <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan’s</span> columns, that it joins our
number. Very glad we are to present it—the only circle,
so far as we remember, composed entirely of young men.
Thirteen of them form this club, all of them connected with
the Highland Congregational Church, of which the Rev. A.
E. Dunning, the honored president of the “Plymouth Rocks,”
has been pastor. A particularly happy suggestion, it seems to
us, is contained in a special feature of their program. They
require each member to suggest at each meeting, in writing,
some subject for the next meeting’s program. These suggestions
being read by the president, the circle selects from them
a sufficient number of topics to occupy the allotted time. The
subjects are then assigned to the various members.——From
two other Massachusetts circles come pleasant letters. One
from <span class="smcap">Cape Cod</span> says: “We call ourselves the ‘Seaside’
circle, and our name is very appropriate, for ‘the sea’
lies both east and south of us. We are located in the ‘elbow’
of the ‘right arm’ of Massachusetts, and scarce an hour in
our lives passes that we do not feel the invigorating breezes
of the Atlantic Ocean. At present we number fourteen regular
and three local members, one ’85, four ’87s, and the rest ’88s.
Our enthusiasm is great, and, as is the experience of every
local circle, increases with every meeting.”——And another
from <span class="smcap">Falmouth</span>: “Our ‘Neptune’ circle is prosperously
started this year with twenty-three active members. We are
encouraged, as this is more than double our last year’s membership.
We try to keep the line of study for each evening
separate, one evening being devoted to science, another to
Greek. Last week we took up the ‘Iliad,’ different members
giving five-minute sketches of its gods and heroes. At other
meetings we have had successful experiments in carbon and
hydrogen. Our local badges bear the letters C. L. S. C., with
the trident, the symbol of our circle.” With this letter the
writer sends a bit of experience which is very interesting.
“Last summer,” she writes, “while visiting the ‘Morning
Star,’ as she lay at the wharf before starting on her noble life
work, I found the C. L. S. C. books in the captain’s library. I
never before so fully realized the bond of sympathy between
Chautauquans. Mrs. Bray, the captain’s wife, told me that
she and her husband belonged to the class of ’85. They take
the readings together while far out on the deep.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Norwich</span> sends us several of its capital programs; peculiarly
attractive is the one for Milton’s Day.——<span class="smcap">Bristol</span> reports a
circle of twenty-four members, organized in October last, and
boasts, most justly, of ten school teachers in its ranks. All the
regular work arranged for circles they have been performing,
and report most pleasant special meetings on Bryant and
Milton Days.——<span class="smcap">Winsted</span> has sent us a New Year greeting.
A happy circle they are, with their enormous membership
of sixty-one members, and “not one lazy one in our
ranks,” the secretary writes.——At <span class="smcap">New Britain</span> the Milton
Day service was very pleasant. The professor of English
literature in the State Normal School gave a talk on Milton,
and the evening closed with a question match.</p>

<p>The plan of reviewing each work read has been adopted at
<span class="smcap">Bristol, R. I.</span> An unusually interesting review was prepared
on the “Art of Speech.” The epitome which the writer gives
of the opening chapter will not only be interesting, it may serve
to disentangle some one’s ideas on the puzzling growth of
English:</p>

<p>The “Knowledge Seekers,” of <span class="smcap">Jamestown, R. I.</span>, form a
new circle. Until this year they were a branch of the local
circle in <span class="smcap">Newport</span>, but as six members were added they have
formed a circle of their own.——“Pawcatuck” local circle,
of the ’88 class, C. L. S. C., was organized September 23,
1884, in the village of <span class="smcap">Carolina</span>, a small manufacturing place in
southern Rhode Island. The circle has now twenty-four members
and meets weekly. Considering the fact that there are
only about 375 inhabitants in the place, in all, and that fully
one half of this number are mill operatives, the size of the
circle is remarkable. The members are all thoroughly interested
in the work, and are taking hold of it in a very commendable
manner.</p>

<p>From all directions throughout <span class="smcap">New York State</span> good news
of growing circles reaches us. Away up north, in <span class="smcap">Jefferson
County</span>, in the village of <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, there has been organized “a
real live C. L. S. C.” It is modeled on the broad Chautauquan
platform, and has three churches represented in its
officers. The program of their Bryant Memorial Day exercises
was a model of happily chosen selections, and we learn
from the columns of their local paper that it was as happily rendered.——A
very profitable plan of assigning subjects is
followed at <span class="smcap">Kingston, N. Y.</span>, in their circle of seven members.
Each member is given, at the beginning of the year, a subject
from the C. L. S. C. readings, to which he devotes his entire
attention; thus our correspondent writes that during last
year she furnished outlines and questions upon the subject of
“Art,” and that this year her theme is “Kitchen Science and
Art.” We like the plan.——In the pleasant town of <span class="smcap">Mount
Kisco</span>, not far from New York City, there is a circle which
dates back to a public meeting in the interests of the C. L. S.
C. held by one of the pastors of the town, in the fall of 1882.
A thriving circle of the class of 1886 still exists there. Their
plan of work is very comprehensive, including Chautauqua
music, general discussions, essays and social observance of
the special days.——The <span class="smcap">Ithaca, N. Y.</span>, C. L. S. C. has a
membership of forty-six of the classes of ’85, ’86, ’87 and ’88.
The meetings, held bi-monthly, are full of life and interest.
They observe memorial days generally. One of their most
active members has moved to <span class="smcap">Cazenovia, N. Y.</span>, Mrs. Rev. H.
F. Spencer, vice president. She writes: “Our circle, here,
is in embryo—think how prosy to come down to a circle of
three or four.”——The <span class="smcap">Newfield</span> circle of fifteen members
was organized last fall, and held their meetings every Friday
evening. Their president, the Rev. W. H. Rogers, is a graduate
of the class of ’82.——In an interesting letter from the president
of a circle at <span class="smcap">Binghamton, N. Y.</span>, we have found some
very good hints. He says: “Here in Binghamton our circle
numbers twenty. We call ourselves the ‘F. F. F.’ circle,
from our motto: ‘Fortiter, fideliter, feliciter’—bravely,
faithfully, successfully. Two things our programs all include:
First, devotional exercises, remembering that ‘we study the
<i>Word</i>’ as well as ‘the works of God.’ We use the Chautauqua
hymns, all singing together and greatly enjoy it. Secondly,
roll call. This is one of our most interesting exercises.
We respond by quotations from one or more authors, specially
designated for the evening, and keep a record of every quotation
given. In this way we are compiling what promises to be
a very interesting book of choice quotations. Our members
are very much in earnest, and every meeting finds them all
present.”——The history of one of the circles at <span class="smcap">Olean, N.
Y.</span>, has been sent us by its secretary: “The ‘Whitney’ circle
(Baptist) was so named in honor of the venerable Dr. Whitney,
one of the fathers of the First Baptist Church. This circle was organized
in the fall of 1883, with a membership of thirty. This fall
we have reorganized, with a membership that bids fair to double
that of last year. Each member, in alphabetical order, takes
part in the exercises, and are nearly all active workers. Our
meetings open with the ‘Chautauqua Songs,’ followed by the
roll call, each member answering with an apt quotation from
the readings. Our program then consists of a drill on subjects
gone over in the readings for the past two weeks. Two
essays, on subjects in harmony with the readings, are read
each evening. We also have interesting scientific experiments
conducted by Dr. S. J. Mudge, a scientist of this city. We
have introduced a novel feature called the ‘Tug of War,’ in
which sides are chosen in spelling-down style, and questions
asked on a book which has been completed. Guesses at the
Greek alphabet and Greek words are also features of our programs.
We also observe some of the memorial days. Last
summer our superintendent, the Rev. MacClymont, secured
Chancellor Vincent to lecture for us. We invited the M. E.
circle, and had a splendid lecture. Taken altogether, we may
say our circle is in a prosperous and flourishing condition.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Keystone State</span> is in no way behind New England
and its <span class="smcap">Empire</span> neighbor this month in reports. From <span class="smcap">Connelsville</span>,
on the banks of the Youghiogheny, comes a hearty
greeting to all C. L. S. C. classmates. It is from the sturdy
“Spartans,” of the class of ’88. The circle, organized on
Opening Day, numbered at its start twenty-four members.
The “Athenian” circle of ’86 and the “Pansy” circle of ’87
proposed a consolidation of forces; so large was the circle that
a public meeting place was necessary. The best talent of the
city is in the circle, and to belong to its rank is a good recommendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
wherever the circle is known.——At <span class="smcap">Mount
Pleasant, Pa.</span>, a circle was formed in October consisting of fifty-one
members, all but four of which belong to the class of ’88.
They promise us a full report when fairly started in their work.——A
friend at <span class="smcap">Verona, Pa.</span>, writes: “Our name is the
‘Verona Resolutes,’ our age two months, our number fifteen.
We owe our existence to the fact that three of our new members
attended Chautauqua Lake Assembly, and one Mountain
Lake Park Assembly, where they caught the C. L. S. C.
fever, and upon returning home spread the disease until fifteen
are found upon the fever list. We are enjoying it, though, and
hope our recovery will be slow, if <i>recovery</i> means loss of interest.”——<span class="smcap">West
Philadelphia</span> has a new circle—the
“Parsonage” circle. They number six and promise to try to
increase their list. No doubt their efforts will succeed, the
present circle being due to the efforts of three members who
last year read alone.——The <i>Elizabeth Herald</i>, of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth,
Pa.</span>, contained recently the following pleasant notice of
the circle in that town: “<span class="smcap">Chautauqua Circle.</span>—This flourishing
institution is pursuing a course of study and research
and enjoying an exchange of ideas, which is a veritable reveling
in intellectual and social pleasures, unknown to many of
the community whose congenial tastes and capabilities would,
if properly directed and cultured, lead them to a sharing of
these delights, so far above the frivolities too common to young
life. For instance, at the regular meeting of this week, in addition
to the regular quiz and discussion of the set topics, the
Milton Memorial Day was observed with services of an appropriate
nature. The evening was a most pleasant one
throughout, and after the regular program was concluded the
members, loth to leave, remained, singing and talking in pleasant,
informal fashion, for some time.”——We are pleased to
notice here, a kindly compliment to the president of the
flourishing circle of thirty at <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Professor Lyon, of
Washington and Jefferson College. Our friend says of him:
“In our studies in chemistry, etc., we have the benefit of his
knowledge and skill, and obliging disposition, for he always
carries from the college to our rooms the apparatus needed for
explanation and experiment.” This circle held a “sociable”
on the evening of December 11th, each member inviting a
friend. It was an enjoyable affair and may be the means of
adding members.——In kind remembrance of Mary Vincent,
the mother of Chancellor Vincent, the members of the C. L. S. C.
at <span class="smcap">Petersburg, Pa.</span> have named their circle the “Mary Vincent”
circle—a peculiarly fitting tribute, Mrs. Vincent having
been well known and deeply honored by many Chautauquans
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, members of the S. H. G. held their
yearly reception to the new class, in the pleasant parlor of the
First Presbyterian Church, in October. The “Irrepressibles”
were right royally received. The president of the society, Mr.
J. G. O’Connell, welcomed the class into the society. The
following were the toasts, to which hearty responses were given:
“The Class of ’82;” “Class of ’83;” “Class of ’84;” “The
Founder of the C. L. S. C.—Chancellor J. H. Vincent;” “Chautauqua,
the Mecca of the C. L. S. C.;” “Cincinnati Circles;”
“Chautauqua Music.” The musical part of the program was unusually
fine. The collation was a part of the program in which
every one present took part. The following are the officers for
the ensuing year: President, Mr. J. G. O’Connell, ’82: vice presidents:
Class of ’82, Mrs. M. J. Pyle; class of ’83, Mrs. I. W.
Joyce; class of ’84, Miss Sarah Trotter; recording secretary,
Miss Julia Kolbe; corresponding secretary, Mr. M. S. Turrill;
treasurer, Miss Selina Wood. The society separated brimful
of enthusiasm for the success of the C. L. S. C. Bryant’s Day
was celebrated by the Cincinnati circles at the Third Presbyterian
Church. Mr. S. Logan presided. Among the excellent
things on the program were an essay on W. C. Bryant, by Mr.
J. A. Johnson, a piano solo by Miss Belle Burnham, and a recitation,
“Waiting by the Gate,” by Miss Nellie Allan. A union
vesper service was held by the circles at Grace M. P. Church,
on the Special Sunday, November 9th. The service was conducted
by the Rev. Mr. Spohr, of Grace Church, and Dr.
Ridgeway, of Mount Auburn, gave a very fine address upon
“Praise.” This being the “Greek” year in the C. L. S. C.
course, the various circles have added to their names that letter
of the Greek alphabet which will indicate their rank in order
of organization.——The local circle of <span class="smcap">Mount Pleasant,
Ohio</span>, came into existence in October of 1883. The circle has
the usual officers, and meets twice a month at the homes of
the members. The enrollment is nineteen, with a large average
attendance. They have local talent enlisted, and the
meetings are instructive and interesting. The work of 1883 and
1884 was thoroughly accomplished.</p>

<p>One new circle enters the list this month from <span class="smcap">Friendswood,
Ind.</span> It is formed of twelve members—enthusiastic and brave
they must be, for they report themselves as living in the country
several miles apart. Not only are they overcoming the
difficulty of regular meetings under these circumstances, they
are contemplating enlisting others in their work.——Another
zealous <span class="smcap">Indiana</span> circle is at <span class="smcap">Corydon</span>. It is a year old,
and believes itself to have done better work than any other
circle in the country, an assertion that their method warrants,
for they have adopted the novel plan of a C. L. S. C. school,
where one member is appointed to hear the lesson and every
other comes prepared to recite. Our Corydon friends gave a
delightful Milton reception to over thirty guests.——The C.
L. S. C. local circle of <span class="smcap">Fort Wayne</span> began its fifth year’s work
on Garfield Day—officers were elected, and seventeen new
members added. The subjects under consideration are conducted
in a conversational manner. One evening was devoted
to chemistry, with highly interesting and successful experiments
given by the leader, who is professor of science at the
M. E. College. They have held one “Sunday Evening Vesper
Service,” which proved such an inspiration that they purpose
having more. “At the age of five years,” they write, “we are
truly ‘Irrepressible,’ ‘Invincible,’ and as firm and steady as
old Plymouth Rock itself.” Altogether “we are a live and
enthusiastic circle, possessed with the true ‘Chautauqua Idea.’”</p>

<p>A letter received from a lady well known to readers of <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, Mrs. E. J. Bugbee, says of a circle lately
started at <span class="smcap">Evanston, Ill.</span>: “I am happy to report from this
glorious Athens of the West a flourishing circle of the C. L. S.
C., organized on the first Monday evening in November, and
numbering now between forty and fifty members. We have
started out with an enthusiasm which we hope will not abate,
and indeed we do not expect it to do so under our present fortunate
leadership. We have for president Mr. Weeden A.
Sawyer, of this place. He presides with dignity and ease, and
carries forward the business of the circle with promptness and
dispatch. We are also happy in our instructor, the Rev. F.
Clatworthy, pastor of the Baptist church of Evanston, who
shows wonderful adaptation for this work, and is heartily in
sympathy with the Chautauqua Idea, and endeavors closely to
follow out the plan for local circles.”——At <span class="smcap">Hinsdale, Ill.</span>,
a circle was organized in the fall of 1882. The circle was conducted
in a very informal manner, having but one officer—secretary—“each
member taking her turn as leader, and our
exercises were merely the discussions of the past week’s reading.
In the fall of 1883 we again organized, this time admitting
gentlemen, electing a president and secretary, and taking
to ourselves a name, ‘The Alpha Chautauqua Circle.’ Our
membership increased to eighteen. Meeting every Monday
evening, our exercises were the same as during the preceding
year. We celebrated three of the memorial days, which proved
not only pleasant and interesting, but very instructive. This
last fall our Chautauquans were so enthusiastic that the first
meeting was called for September 4th. We reorganized with
only nine members; since then have admitted two more. If
it can be possible, our work this year seems more interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
than ever. We continue to meet weekly, and have now decided
to take one text-book, or one month’s reading in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> at a time, finishing one subject before taking
up another; thinking thereby to obtain a better understanding
of the same. Shall also use the questions and answers in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, said lessons to be conducted the same as a
spelling match. The members respond to the roll call with
appropriate quotations, thus far from Greek authors. We have
been too busy to observe the memorial days this year, otherwise
than by quotations from the author in question. Two of
our circle are members of the ‘Pansy’ class. One of our
number graduated last year, who is now an honorary member
of the local circle, acting as critic; and we shall have one
graduate this year.”</p>

<p>A genuine proof of good work is this bit of experience from
<span class="smcap">Tecumseh, Mich.</span>: “At the beginning of this year,” the president
writes, “we members of ’86 reviewed thoroughly our
Greek history for the benefit of those of our circle belonging
to the classes of ’87 and ’88. We were highly gratified with
the proficiency of the class of ’86. How well we remember
two years ago the despondency of many of the members at the
hard Greek words, and now they pronounce them with ease
and fluency. Any one would have been convinced of the benefits
of the C. L. S. C. who could have listened to those reviews
of Greek history.”——The Bryant memorial was very pleasantly
observed by the local circle of <span class="smcap">Escanaba, Mich.</span> Mrs.
W. H. Tibbals, ’86, invited the members to dinner at 6 o’clock.
Nine of the members were present. After the repast, at which
each member present received as a souvenir a pallet painted
by the hostess, the literary feast was enjoyed. Select reading,
“Early Life of the Author;” selection, “The Rivulet;”
selection, “The Autumn Woods;” essay, Bryant and his Contemporaries;
selection, “The Planting of the Apple Tree;”
selection, “The Crowded Street;” essay, Bryant, the Poet;
analytical study of the “West Wind;” questions prepared by
the president.</p>

<p>Sad news and a beautiful tribute to the C. L. S. C. come to
us from <span class="smcap">Waupan, Wis.</span>, whence the secretary writes: “Our
C. L. S. C. opens this year with added enthusiasm in its membership,
and an increasing number. The Bryant Memorial
Day was observed in a fitting manner by sentiments, readings,
discussion, and a biographical sketch, all bearing upon the
great poet. The selections and topics were in accord with our
feelings, as we had just met with our first loss since organizing
five years ago, in the death of one of our youngest and brightest
members, Mrs. Jennie Weed Hinkley. As we review the
life of our beloved sister, we can see a symmetry and beauty
of character that needed no further lights and shades. Our
studies make us better mothers and housekeepers, better able
to take our places in the prayer meeting, better able to guide
our children, and to understand the work they do in the
school room.”——The “Pansy” class of <span class="smcap">Sparta, Wis.</span>, also
sends its greetings to all the members of the People’s College.
A friend telling the story of the circle says: “Our little Spartan
class passed through the first year of its existence without a
break in the circle, and profiting by the favorable circumstances,
observed among others, Shakspere Memorial Day with
more than the ordinary preparation, closing with a basket picnic,
served at the house of one of the members. This year,
however, sickness has overtaken two of the members, and one
still remains an invalid; nevertheless, our progress has been
steady. We have observed Bryant’s and Milton’s Days by
interesting exercises.”</p>

<p>The C. L. S. C. is coming well to the front this year in <span class="smcap">St.
Paul, Minn.</span> The year was begun by a lecture from Dr. Vincent
on Monday evening, October 6th, on the “Chautauqua
Idea.” This aroused the enthusiasm of the old Chautauquans
and brought in a large addition of new members. On Thursday
evening, October 23d, the “Pioneer” circle was reorganized
with nineteen members, which have since become twenty-five.
On Monday evening, November 3d (Bryant Day), the
“Canadian American” circle was formed, with ten members.
There have been at least four other circles formed, with a
membership of about eighty. On the evening of November 27th,
Thanksgiving night, the “Pioneer” circle held its regular
meeting in the parlors of the First M. E. Church. All the
other circles in the city were represented, about eighty persons
being present. Among the other visitors they were delighted
to welcome Prof. J. L. Corning, of Ocean Grove, N. J., a name
well known to all Chautauquans. His address on the C. L. S.
C. at Ocean Grove and the Chautauqua University was both
instructive and enjoyable. The program was in celebration of
both Bryant and Thanksgiving Days, and included essays on
Bryant’s life and works and the origin of Thanksgiving day,
with selections from Bryant’s works and Thanksgiving day
poems. Altogether the evening was a very pleasant one.
They are making arrangements for forming a central circle
somewhat after the plan of the Toronto central circle and the
Troy circle.</p>

<p>Three new circles are reported this month from <span class="smcap">Iowa</span>. At
<span class="smcap">Wapello</span> a circle of five members; at <span class="smcap">Parkersburg</span> one of
nine members; and at <span class="smcap">Elvira</span>, one of ten. Each reports the
work as a delightful revelation, and expresses the hope that
they may be able to largely increase their numbers.——In
the fall of 1883 a circle was organized in <span class="smcap">Missouri Valley,
Iowa</span>. It consisted of some fifteen members, some of whom,
for want of time, failed to do the reading. During the past
year a number of the members left the town, one of whom—President
Sabine—graduated in the class of 1884. Though the
class is scattered, several are doing the reading.</p>

<p>We are always particularly glad to hear from the <span class="smcap">Blue
Grass State</span>, perhaps because our friends there have not sent
us frequent reports. This month a friend writes of the circle
at <span class="smcap">Hardensburg</span>: “The C. L. S. C. of this place is prosecuting
its work with unabating energy and zeal. We organized
early in September, with eighteen members, that we might be
entirely ready for Opening Day. However, there was so much
severe illness in our town, and especially among some of the
friends of our circle, that it was late in the Circle year before
we did anything more toward having a meeting. When at
last through the Father’s providence we were permitted to
meet again, we found that nearly every member had ‘read
up’ to date. We meet on Tuesday evening of each week and
carry out the program as furnished for each week in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>. We keep each memorial day.”</p>

<p>Another Southern state to report is <span class="smcap">Louisiana</span>. From <span class="smcap">Lake
Providence</span> this letter comes: “We have twenty-two members
between fifteen and twenty-one years old. We meet once
a week; at roll call each answers by reciting, ‘We study the
Word and works of God,’ ‘Let us keep our Heavenly Father
in the midst,’ ‘Never be discouraged.’ We assign lessons
from the C. L. S. C. course for each week as given by <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>. In our class the member who is most attentive,
whose conduct is best, who learns the lessons recited most thoroughly,
is made president of the class. The places of vice
president, secretary, etc., are filled in this way. The lessons
which have been memorized by particular members, are
learned at their recital by the other members who were not
appointed to learn these lessons. In this way the work is
done thoroughly, and for hours the interest and enthusiasm do
not cool; however, we change from one study to another to
prevent any from becoming monotonous. Nineteen members
of our circle are college students, but for the most of them this
will be their last year at school; so we are trying to fill them
with the Chautauqua spirit of learning, morality, truth and
Christian worth, that it may linger with them and develop
them through all the future into strong and true, noble and
pure womanhood and manhood. Having established this circle
among the young, we are now working to originate one
among the grown. We talk of it a great deal in our social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
life; have induced eight to become members of the C. L. S.
C., and hope to largely increase the numbers.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Springfield, Missouri</span>, sends the following interesting history:
“In October, 1883, a wave of Chautauqua enthusiasm
reached our beautiful city of the Ozarks. Through the influence
of two or three energetic ladies, it resulted in the organization
of the ‘Queen City’ circle of the C. L. S. C. The circle
began with a membership of fifteen ladies, representing eight
religious denominations. Regular meetings were held once a
week, all the memorial days kept, and the year’s work finished
in June. In October, 1884, our circle was reorganized with the
same officers. Our members returned full of enthusiasm and
ready for work. On Opening Day we endeavored to lay before
our new members and visitors—having opened our doors to
all interested—the object, the magnitude and the blessing of
the ‘Chautauqua Idea.’ Those interested, and others to whom
the ‘Idea’ was entirely new caught the enthusiasm, and many
applications for membership were presented from both gentlemen
and ladies. As the ‘Queen City’ circle is a woman’s
circle exclusively, holding its meetings in the afternoon, it was
thought best to organize another circle, to which both ladies
and gentlemen could be admitted. On Bryant’s Day the new
circle was formed, with a membership of thirty-one. Their
meetings will be held on Tuesday evening of each week. It
is the intention of the two circles to work together as closely
as possible. The ‘Queen City’ circle meets once a week
in a pleasant parlor, which we owe to the courtesy of
one of our members. We study the readings for the week
thoroughly. Topics are assigned by our instruction committee
a week in advance for special study, greater research and more
thought being thus brought to bear upon the lesson. Criticism
upon pronunciation, inaccuracies of speech, etc., is unsparingly
given to all. We are trying to make thorough study
of our text-book on ‘Parliamentary Practice,’ and endeavor
to observe all the rules of a deliberative body. Our work is
both profitable and delightful, and I think it safe to say that
our circle can never languish. Already the ’87s are living in
joyful anticipation of the day when they will be permitted to
pass beneath the Arches at Chautauqua.”——A word also
comes from <span class="smcap">Kansas City</span>. There are six circles there, the
oldest of which is the “Kansas City” circle, whose interest
was so great that the weekly meetings were kept up during last
summer, without any vacation. October 1st, they reorganized,
with a membership of twenty-five. Two graduates are reading
with this circle this year.</p>

<p>A pleasant account of work done in the interest of the C.
L. S. C. has reached our table from <span class="smcap">Hiawatha, Kansas</span>. A
graduate of the class of ’84 it comes from: “I have talked
C. L. S. C. to my friends until I have declared that it will soon
be necessary for me to get a new tongue. I went to our editor
to-day and asked his assistance in spreading the work. He
has kindly consented to print whatever we wish. There are
many things in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> that would enlighten the
people concerning the C. L. S. C.—what it is, and what it is
doing—but the very ones who most need this information do
not take <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. By the assistance of our editor
we can bring this knowledge to the people. I tell my friends
that I can not help being enthusiastic on this subject, because
I am an ‘Irrepressible.’ A ‘Pioneer’ and an ‘Invincible’
moved to our town this fall. Beside these we have a few ‘Progressives,’
‘Pansies,’ and ‘Plymouth Rocks.’ We meet in one
of the offices in the court house for our regular meetings—it
being a more central point for all—but I invited the circle to
my home for a late meeting. I wished to show them the growth
of the Persian empire and Alexander’s dominions as pictured
on Adams’s ‘Synchronological Chart.’ I bought one this summer
at Chautauqua. Since my return I made an easel for the
chart of hard pine, open-mortised four cross-pieces, on two of
which I fastened the chart, and chamfered the edges. The
boards were ‘in the rough’ when I took them, but I smoothed
them, sand-papered and oiled them, then blackened the chamfered
edges and varnished the easel. Several carpenters have
examined my work and all say my joining is perfect and the
work well done, and yet I never handled tools until I went to
Chautauqua last summer and took instructions.”——A new
circle has been organized at <span class="smcap">Hartford, Kansas</span>. It consists
of seventeen members, representing a variety of professions and
employments. The work has proven pleasant and profitable
to them thus far.</p>

<p>Right glad we are to hear from <span class="smcap">Nebraska</span>. A breezy letter
comes from the circle at <span class="smcap">York</span>, in which the writer tells us: “We
have twenty-four members. We feel quite encouraged when
we remember that we began last year with only four. Nearly
every meeting adds a new name to our roll. Our members
are all enthusiastic and in earnest, preferring to let anything
else go rather than miss one ‘C. L. S. C.’ I really think nothing
less than a ‘Nebraska blizzard’ or cyclone would keep
some of our members away. We pursued the Chautauqua
plan of questions and answers last year very successfully, and
are proceeding in the same way this year, although our programs
vary according to the option of the leader. Each member
leads in the order his name stands on the secretary’s
roll. In this way the timid ones of our circle are brought out.
We usually have written questions on the readings in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>; they are either handed to the secretary to be
read, or exchanged. We are fortunate in having a professor of
our college as a member, and just now he is making the study
of chemistry very interesting and pleasant. We certainly do
appreciate our C. L. S. C.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyoming Territory</span> is the western limit of our circle travels
for February. At <span class="smcap">Cheyenne</span>, the “J. L. Taylor” circle organized
in 1883 has reorganized with a membership of twelve. The secretary
writes: “While we are all young people, having many daily
duties and cares, our interest in Chautauqua steadily increases,
as we feel it broadens our outlook over the world, and draws
us nearer and nearer to our ideal of a higher life. We hope to
be able to report much good work done in the future—as we
feel that we can not stop with only moderate endeavors.”</p>

<p>President Underwood would be glad if circles composed of
members of the Class of ’85 would inform him of their existence
and send name of president and secretary, that he may
visit them when possible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Canadian classmate writes: “I am prosecuting my studies
in connection with the C. L. S. C. all alone in a remote corner
of our country, and find my greatest pleasure in holding communion
with the good and great of the present and past ages.
I am well pleased with the motto for our class and hope to be
among those who verify its appropriateness by passing through
the Gates next summer at Chautauqua.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>One member of ’85 writes: “Having just read the December
column of ’85 in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, have concluded to
show my enthusiasm by sending for our colors.” We can all
say amen to this: “Please place my name on the roll of the
Invincibles, and may God for dear Jesus’ sake help us all to
‘Press on, reaching after those things which are before.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another says: “Although I was nearly fifty years of age
when I commenced study in this way, yet am greatly interested
and love it more and more. I hope to ‘press on, reaching
after those things which are before,’ until I can stand in
the immediate presence of Him whom my soul loveth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Kentucky comes this testimony: “I am hoping to be
able, literally, to ‘pass through the Gates’ next August and
receive from Chancellor Vincent my diploma. I was at Chautauqua
in ’83, and will not be content till I go again. My interest
and enthusiasm increase as the four years draw to a close.
During this time I have pursued my studies alone, having failed
entirely to form even a ‘straight line’ in my neighborhood, five
miles from Versailles. Although I would doubtless have enjoyed
being connected with a circle, I know that studying the
course, even alone, has very greatly benefited me. One of
these benefits, and by no means the least, has been the increasing
and strengthening of my taste for solid reading.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">New York.</span>—“I have often wished that I could express my
gratitude for, and appreciation of, my C. L. S. C. studies and
associations, but when I attempt it my list of adjectives seems
all too meager and inadequate. Since taking up the course, life
and all that pertains to it assume a different aspect. I have
gained an outlook which gives life a charm and attractiveness
of which I had never dreamed. I had passed my forty-fifth
year when I comprehended the C. L. S. C. plan sufficiently to
see that it was for such illiterate people as I. The benefits I
have received are past computation.”</p>

<p>Our Class Memorial to our loved alma mater must not be
forgotten. We want to prepare for a memorial, a present
worthy our <i>name</i> and <i>aim</i>. Fifty-five (55) names have up to
this time been sent to the treasurer, with contributions to the
class fund (some sending more than the amount requested).
That is but a small beginning of the hundreds to hear from.</p>

<p>From Colorado—Durango—comes this encouraging bit of class
news: “We have eleven members in our class and are pursuing
our studies this winter with unabated interest. Belonging to
the class of ’86, we mean to be true to the name ‘Progressives.’
We hold our meetings every Monday evening, and follow the
program laid out in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. There seems to be
a growing interest in the Chautauqua work, and we hope to
have another class organized in our little town before many
months. The members of the present class are busy workers,
teachers, mothers and housekeepers, but they have continued
the course with increasing interest to this the third year, and
purpose finishing the full course.”</p>

<p>The New England Branch of the Pansy class held its reunion
November 28th in the People’s Church in Boston. The first
hour, from one to two p. m., was spent in social enjoyment.
Prof. Sherwin then introduced himself in one of his characteristic
speeches and concluded by presenting the New England
president, the Rev. F. M. Gardner. He was unknown to
many of the members, as he was elected on the last day of the
Framingham Assembly, when many of the class had gone
home. The president made an appropriate and pleasing address.
The secretary, Miss Corey, then read her report. The
pupils of the Boston Conservatory of Music, under the direction
of Prof. Sherwin, gave a delightful musical entertainment.
At the close of the musical program the Rev. J. W. Hamilton,
pastor of the church, addressed the class in a very happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
interesting manner. A class poem was read by Miss Nell
Robinson, of Lowell, Mass., which finds its place in this Pansy
column this month. After some business the meeting was
closed by singing a Chautauqua song. Nearly one hundred
and fifty were present at this meeting. During the session
the secretary called attention to the samples of class paper
which had been sent on from Atlanta by direction of the committee
appointed at Chautauqua last summer. The samples
met the approval of those present.</p>

<h3>II.—TWENTY-FIVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON “CHEMISTRY”—FROM
BEGINNING OF BOOK TO PAGE 84.</h3>

<p>26. Q. Of what does chemistry treat? A. All kinds of material
substances.</p>

<p>27. Q. What is said of the number of the various kinds of
matter already existing on our earth? A. The number is so
great that the various kinds have never been so much as
counted, much less described, in any list or volume.</p>

<p>28. Q. Of what are all things known to chemists made up?
A. A few simple substances, either existing alone or in richly
various combinations.</p>

<p>29. Q. What are called chemical elements, and what compounds?
A. The simplest substances when alone are called
the chemical elements, or elementary substances; the things
resulting when different elements are united are called compounds.</p>

<p>30. Q. What does the two-fold character of chemical study
involve? A. First, the examination of elementary substances
and their compounds. Second, a consideration of the many
general and special laws and forces which determine the various
possible combinations.</p>

<p>31. Q. How many elementary substances are there now generally
recognized as such? A. Sixty-six.</p>

<p>32. Q. About how many of the elements possess names that
are familiar to ordinary readers? A. About one sixth of them.</p>

<p>33. Q. Of what two elementary substances is it probable
that three fourths of our globe is composed? A. Of oxygen
one half, and of silicon one fourth.</p>

<p>34. Q. What general name is given to most of the elements?
A. Metals.</p>

<p>35. Q. What symbol and what weight has each element? A.
An atomic symbol and an atomic weight.</p>

<p>36. Q. How is an atom of each elementary substance designated?
A. By a symbol, usually the initial letter of the native
or Latin name of the substance.</p>

<p>37. Q. What are three properties an elementary substance
accepted as a metal should possess? A. It must possess the
property of existing in a solid condition; it should possess the
metallic luster; and it should possess the power and tendency
to readily form a chemical union with oxygen.</p>

<p>38. Q. What are called binary and what ternary compounds?
A. Compounds having only two kinds of elements are called
binaries. Compounds having three kinds of elements are
called ternaries.</p>

<p>39. Q. What four binary compounds are given as examples?
A. Hydric chloride, sulphur di-oxide, sulphur tri-oxide, and
plumbic oxide.</p>

<p>40. Q. Under what two heads are the principal ternaries
grouped? A. Acids and salts.</p>

<p>41. Q. What are the two principal ternary acids used by
chemists? A. Nitric acid and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>42. Q. What is meant by the term atom? A. It is that portion
of any kind of matter that is to human beings indivisible
in fact.</p>

<p>43. Q. With what invisible, occult power is each atom and
each molecule endowed? A. A power called chemical affinity.</p>

<p>44. Q. What are three of the peculiarities of chemical affinity?
A. Each kind of atom has its peculiar chemical affinities.
Each atom has a certain equivalence or atom-fixing
power. Chemical changes produce striking results.</p>

<p>45. Q. What is the most common way of producing hydrogen?
A. By bringing together sulphuric acid and zinc.</p>

<p>46. Q. What are some of the properties of hydrogen as a
gas? A. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and, bulk for bulk,
it is the lightest substance known in nature.</p>

<p>47. Q. What is the most interesting chemical property of
hydrogen? A. Its power to unite with oxygen.</p>

<p>48. Q. What is said of the uses to which hydrogen may be
put? A. As an elementary gas it finds but few applications in
the arts.</p>

<p>49. Q. For what standards is hydrogen used by chemists?
A. As the standard of equivalence or atom-fixing power; the
standard of atomic weight, and the standard of density for
gases.</p>

<p>50. Q. What did the remarkable lightness of hydrogen early
suggest? A. The fitness of that gas for the inflation of balloons.</p>

<h3>III.—TWENTY-FIVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON “HOW TO HELP
THE POOR.”</h3>

<p>51. Q. What is the aim of the book, “How to Help the
Poor?” A. To give a few suggestions to visitors among the

which are now held weekly in almost every district of our large
cities.</p>

<p>52. Q. What is one of the most direct commands in the
Christian Scripture? A. “Give to him that asketh.”</p>

<p>53. Q. Why need there be no beggars in our American
cities? A. Labor is wanted everywhere, especially educated
labor; nowhere is the supply of the latter equal to the demand.</p>

<p>54. Q. What do the people crying continually “give to us”
really need? A. A chance to learn how to work, and sufficient
protection in the meantime from the evils of idleness,
drunkenness and vice.</p>

<p>55. Q. What is “out-door relief?” A. It is the giving of
money (or its equivalent) which is raised by taxing the people,
if the applicants come under certain rules and laws.</p>

<p>56. Q. To what conclusion does Mr. Seth Low, of Brooklyn,
N. Y., come in regard to “out-door relief?” A. That out-door
relief, in the United States as elsewhere, tends inevitably
and surely to increase pauperism.</p>

<p>57. Q. Of what three parts is the conference of a district
composed? A. First, the district committee; second, the representatives
of societies and officers; third, the visitors.</p>

<p>58. Q. How does one writer state that the disciplining of our
immense poor population must be effected? A. By individual
influence; and this power can change it from a mob of paupers
and semi-paupers into a body of self-dependent workers.</p>

<p>59. Q. What does not, and what does visiting the poor
mean? A. Visiting the poor does not mean entering the room
of a person hitherto unknown to make a call. It means that
we are invited to visit a miserable abode for the purpose, first,
of discovering the cause of that misery.</p>

<p>60. Q. What does Dr. Tuckerman say of every child who
is a beggar? A. Every child who is a beggar, almost without
exception, will become a vagrant and probably a thief.</p>

<p>61. Q. What is the only just reason for taking children from
their natural homes? A. To lift them out of moral poverty.
Material poverty, alone, is not sufficient cause.</p>

<p>62. Q. What do the statistics of the Labor Bureau show in
regard to homeless young women in Boston? A. That there
are twenty thousand homeless young women in Boston whose
wages average only four dollars per week.</p>

<p>63. Q. What is the first suggestion made for the better care
of the aged? A. By patient study of each individual, and by
ingenious experiment of one plan after another, some fit occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
can often be found which shall bring both happiness
and profit.</p>

<p>64. Q. When does not private charity do its full part? A.
While any other than almshouse cases are allowed to fall into
the care of the city authorities.</p>

<p>65. Q. What does experience, as the opportunities for observation
widen, induce the writer to believe? A. That every
human being can do something if he has a chance, and is intended
to fill some gap in the universal plan.</p>

<p>66. Q. What does Edward Denison say of the crime of begging?
A. It does not consist in the mere solicitation of alms.
The gist of the offense is the intention of preying upon society;
and of this intent the asking alms is only evidence—not proof.</p>

<p>67. Q. What is the root of a very large proportion of the suffering
of the poor in the cities of America? A. Drunkenness.</p>

<p>68. Q. What is one of the first duties of a visitor in entering
a tenement house? A. To use his senses.</p>

<p>69. Q. What knowledge means physical salvation, and thus
a better prospect for understanding the spiritual? A. How to
make even the smallest home clean and attractive, and to get
the largest return from every dollar earned.</p>

<p>70. Q. What is one of the earliest and most important topics
which should engage the attention of the visitor? A. That of
helping people to save.</p>

<p>71. Q. What drives people into solitude? A. Trouble of
any kind, and especially any misfortune which has a tendency
to lower a person in the social scale.</p>

<p>72. Q. What is said of many of the poor who most deeply
need visitors? A. They are lonely persons, and the fact of
finding a friend at last is encouragement to them and the
beginning of better times.</p>

<p>73. Q. What is almost the only true help of the worldly sort
which it is possible to give the poor? A. To teach them how
to use even the small share of goods and talents intrusted to
them.</p>

<p>74. Q. What truth has been made clear in regard to the expenditure
of money and goods alone? A. That it does not alleviate
poverty.</p>

<p>75. Q. What has experience taught differently from the assertions
that certain evils can not be helped, and that we may
as well let things alone? A. That evils can be helped, and to
let things alone is to lend ourselves to wrong.</p>

<h3>CAN LANGUAGE BE TAUGHT BY CORRESPONDENCE?</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY PROF. R. S. HOLMES, A.M.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Can a language be taught by correspondence? Unhesitatingly,
yes! Experience, though brief, gives warrant for the
answer. The constantly increasing number of advertisements
appearing in journals of wide circulation gives evidence that
teachers at least believe instruction by this method both possible
and profitable. It is in this belief that the only danger
to the system lies. Incompetency in this field must fail. It
can be hidden by no outward show. No would-be teacher,
with text-book and printed question in hand, can parade before
a class and <i>hear a recitation</i>. Only a teacher, a real
teacher, can hope for success in this work, and that must come
by methods entirely foreign to the ordinary methods of the
class-room. Born a teacher, not made; such must be he who
would successfully use the correspondence system in his work
of teaching. Such teachers are rare, even in comparison with
the multitudes of those who already fill the places in our hundreds
of thousands of schools, and still more rare in the ranks
of the throng which, filling the avenues leading to them, is
expectantly awaiting the constantly occurring vacancies. For
this reason we have said that the growing demand for correspondence
schools constitutes their principal danger; for persons
aware of this demand and allured by the hope of swelling
moderate incomes, though they have no peculiar appreciation
of the particular requirements demanded to fit one for
the work, will yet enter the lists as competitors in this field.
The inevitable results must be failure by the teacher, discouragement
to honest and earnest students who can find no other
means for acquiring education, distrust of the practicability of
the system, and discredit for correspondence teachers as a
class. To avoid this, to provide only competent instructors,
and to arrange and systematize as broad and comprehensive
a course of study as is furnished by an institution is one of the
purposes of the Chautauqua University. In such a course languages,
ancient and modern, must be taught, and must be
taught by correspondence, or not at all. But while it will be
conceded that instruction by correspondence is possible, in
ordinary branches, yet the honest inquirer will ask in view of
the peculiarities surrounding the subject of foreign languages,
the question which begins this paper: Can a language be
taught by correspondence? Again we answer, unhesitatingly,
yes! and in no dubious way, but with a measure of success
fully equal to that possible by oral instruction. The question
of the time necessary to complete any given topic is not germane
to this discussion. Yet in passing, it may be said, that of
two persons who should be able to devote their whole time to
study, one using oral and the other correspondence methods,
we see no reason why the first should have any advantage in
point of time required for the completion of any prescribed
course of study.</p>

<p>We present four reasons in support of the answer we have
so positively given:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>—<i>The class of students seeking this instruction is more
teachable than can be easily found elsewhere.</i> Its members
rank in earnestness and intensity of application with the best
of those pursuing post-graduate or special courses in resident
and special institutions. They are men already in professional
life, physicians, attorneys, pastors, journalists and
teachers. They are men who, having long looked wistfully
from a distance at our great educational institutions without
being able to avail themselves of their advantages, suddenly
find excellent educational advantages brought to their very
doors and offered on terms which they can easily accept.
They are young men and women who during their school days
felt the necessity of making the best use of their time, and acquired
habits of steady application, of critical study, and of
economy in the use of spare moments; but whose school days
were limited by unconquerable circumstances to the village
academy or high school, or even to the less ambitious country
district school. These classes are easier to teach than almost
any other, since they are ready to do to the fullest extent the
work which alone can make any teaching successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second</span>—<i>More skill is required in the work of preparing and
assigning lessons than is ordinarily shown.</i> The art of assigning
lessons should form a part in every scheme of pedagogical
instruction. Unfortunately, the methods with which
most who have memories of the class room are familiar are
worthy subjects for criticism. The recitation hour passes
rapidly in question and answer over the technicalities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
text. The closing moments are sufficient to direct a continuation
of the advance reading, a review of previous lessons, and
the assignment of certain portions from the grammar. There
is no definite direction as to special points to be examined;
no provision for particular work in etymology, or analysis, or
comparison; no synthetic outline for the next day’s thought;
no aids to help the student to test his own work or to detect
his own errors before the next recitation assembly. Such
methods or lack of methods in the correspondence school
would surely cause its failure. How to assign lessons becomes
here the crucial test of the teacher’s power. He must so lay
out the work to be done that the pupil whom he has never
seen will be stimulated to effort and not grow discouraged;
will be led from the world of the known at his feet, into the
world of the unknown in which the teacher lives; will be allowed
to make no misuse of time in unprofitable study; will
be wisely directed in the acquirement of lexical and grammatical
knowledge, and will be enabled to test his own work
with ever increasing accuracy. Such a teacher can not fail of
success in his effort to teach a language by correspondence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third</span>—<i>More care is required in the matter of interrogation.</i>
Thorough mastery of the art of interrogation is an essential;
almost priceless in any teaching—here it is a <i>sine qua non</i>.
The presence of teacher and pupil in the class room makes
questioning easy; the oral question is quickly given, quickly
answered, and many questions may be used to elicit a single
truth, or to impress a single lesson. But the correspondence
teacher is not so favored. His questions must be so framed
that one, or at the most two, shall suffice. Again, the oral
teacher through lack of memory and long custom, may allow
his questions to become a mere matter of routine, and daily
tread the same monotonous round. We speak from memory
when we assert of a college class, that it became so familiar
with the questions asked during Greek hour in junior year, as
to be able to answer the coming question almost before its utterance.
This will not do for the correspondence teacher.
His questions must be only such as his lesson directions have
suggested; they must be committed to paper, in remorseless
ink; they are to be subjected to scrutiny; they must not be
obscure, or repetitious; and their range must be as wide as
his students’ knowledge. Such questioning can not fail of
success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth</span>—<i>More earnest and thorough study is required of the
student.</i> He has in a certain sense the work of two persons to
perform, his own and his teacher’s; his own, in that he investigates
and acquires as directed; his teacher’s, in that he must
prove and test that which he has done and is doing, by efforts
of memory, by work of comparison, and by strict grammatical
rule. He must recite to himself, ask of himself the questions
which he must answer, and correct himself before finally his
finished work is returned to his teacher for revision.</p>

<p>We think we have made sufficiently plain the possibility of
success in teaching a language by correspondence. The reasons
seem to us conclusive. That which remains to be said is
even more potent. After all thinking, reasoning and objecting
is done, after all testimony for or against has been received
the established fact remains, successful teaching of languages,
ancient and modern, by correspondence alone, has been done
within the years just past, is now being done, and will be yet
more effectively and widely done with each advancing year.</p>

<p>In support of these statements, which we believe are true, we
present a testimonial from an experienced teacher, who has
been and is a member of the College of Modern Languages in
the Chautauqua University. It is as follows:</p>

<p>“I have been a member of the German class in the Chautauqua
Correspondence School of Languages for two years,
and I consider this plan of study, including the six weeks’ instruction
each year at Chautauqua, superior to any other.
The method is not only more comprehensive, it also advances
the pupil much more rapidly, makes him more thorough,
broadens his culture, enables him to become familiar with history,
with literature, with art, and better than all, teaches him
how to acquire knowledge.”</p>

<p>We add two statements of fact which can be verified as
proofs of popular opinion regarding correspondence schools:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>—That the Director of the Department of New Testament
Greek in the Chautauqua School of Theology has students
to the number of almost four hundred who rely for instruction
entirely upon correspondence lessons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second</span>—That the Dean of the Department of Hebrew in
the same institution has under instruction by the same methods,
in the different enterprises with which he is connected,
about seven hundred students. Could there be anything more
significant?</p>

<h3>“MINOR MORALS.”</h3>

<p>The importance of good breeding can not be too diligently
insisted upon. But what is good breeding? This is hardly
to be understood as synonymous with good manners, though
certainly involving them. Nor is it quite the same thing as
exemplary or agreeable behavior, though likely to insure it.
The latter is entirely the product of constant practice. Good
manners, polished behavior, are the fruit of long discipline—perfection
herein being reached only when these manners become
habitual, natural, instinctive.</p>

<p>True courtesy, meanwhile, involves something deeper than
mere manners or motions. It has its seat in the heart—its root
in the moral nature. Fundamentally it consists in an inward
kindly, neighborly, tender feeling toward every one, an interest
in, and a desire to promote everybody’s welfare. Genuine
courtesy, in a word, is born of love, springs from a
benevolent disposition, a brotherly, chivalric impulse.</p>

<p>But what is good breeding? It consists in this inward principle
of good will, and the outward <i>habit</i> of graceful demeanor
combined—it consists in the aforesaid inward gracious
impulse, rooted in the heart, and finding natural outward expression,
or interpretation, through that disciplined elegance
of deportment of which I have spoken. To the inward impulse,
or sentiment, duly awakened, the outward, educated
habit naturally, instinctively responds; and we have the deportment,
or carriage, of the truly polished or accomplished
gentleman or lady.</p>

<p>These twin principles, the inward nurture and the outward
culture or training, working together, underlie what in the
highest sense is to be understood as good breeding.</p>

<p>The practical value of the accomplishment under consideration
can not well be overestimated. How charming, truly,
this gentlemanly, lady-like conduct—this kindly, graceful,
genial way of carrying one’s self socially. True courtesy,
verily, is as delightful as a song. More eloquent is it, we may
say, than any oratory. It is a fine art. Better still, it is
Christian.</p>

<p>Is it not at once a privilege and a duty to promote the pleasure
of others? As has just been suggested, how may we more
effectually minister to the pleasure of others than by a charming
behavior?</p>

<p>By cultivated, agreeable manners, moreover, we immensely
enhance our personal influence—our power for good. A person
of agreeable manners, by uniformly pleasing, will, naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
always be popular—have hosts of friends. While, whatever
one’s worth or attainments, we yet shun his presence if he
be disagreeable or offensive in manner or speech; on the
other hand, we instinctively covet the society of one who, in
any way, delights us.</p>

<p>The irresistible charm of polished manners, even when cultivated
solely for commercial purposes, is well illustrated by a
remark said to have been made by Mr. Beecher concerning
the clerks in the shops of Paris. They were, he said, so polite
and engaging in their attentions that his first impression always
was that he must have met them somewhere before.
And who has not, indeed, under the influence of the benign
spirit, the genial and engaging manners, the kindly and
obliging offices of the accomplished tradesman, often felt his
prejudices give way, his original intentions to purchase nothing
yield, and, instead, a purpose gradually spring up in his
mind to do just the opposite of what he originally designed?</p>

<p>Nothing can be more evident, therefore, than that this matter
of manners and breeding is a no unimportant part of one’s
education, constituting, truly, a no insignificant part of every
true man’s character. How greatly, then, does that youth
stand in his own light, who, for any cause, neglects his manners.
The thoroughly courteous youth, other things equal,
will surely win his way to success. Personally agreeable in
all his ways, he conciliates opposing prejudices, charms the
indifferent, and makes every one he meets his friend. The
boorish man, on the contrary, as inevitably blocks his way to
fortune by awakening, on the part of those with whom he has
to do, only sentiments of aversion and disgust.</p>

<p>Girls, for some reason, seem to take more naturally and
kindly to graceful ways, to gentle courtesies, than boys.
Young America, we think, is characteristically boorish, if not
clownish. The boy of the period manifestly places no adequate
value on good manners. Doubtless this matter of breeding—this
careful cultivation of a genial and amiable deportment—is
sadly neglected in our day. The youth of our day
should be taught not only that rudeness and vulgarity never
pay; but that while awkwardness is disagreeable and burdensome,
the slightest approach to rowdyism is detestable and unpardonable.</p>

<p>Some one has very happily represented good manners as
“minor morals.” And certain it is that vulgarity and vice are
intimately related; that the low, vulgar fellow will ever be
found but a few removes from a positively vicious one.</p>

<p>Love, refinement, social cultivation are all closely allied with
righteousness; these, always and everywhere, constitute the
true gentleman and lady.</p>

<h3>THE COUNCILS AT BALTIMORE.</h3>

<p>It was a noteworthy fact that two of the three great religious
bodies of this country were holding councils in the same city
in the last days of 1884. The city of Baltimore enjoys the distinction
of being both a Catholic and a Methodist city. The
former is the older claimant, since it was founded by English
Catholics; but Methodism, also founded by Englishmen, has
a Baltimore history which occasioned the centennial conference
of last month. It was in Baltimore, Christmas 1784, that
a few circuit riders organized the Methodist Episcopal Church.
It is doubtless through the effectiveness of that organization
that Methodism holds its position as the religious union of the
largest <i>population</i> embraced in any one organization in this
country. The Catholics are ordinarily reckoned the most
numerous, because they count population and Methodists
count only members; but taking the former basis as a common
measure, the various branches of Methodism are doubtless
the most numerous; and it is probable that by the same
tests the Baptists outnumber the Catholics. If the Presbyterian
bodies could be counted together, and the Lutherans and
Congregationalists included, we should have a third great body
of Protestants which may possibly outnumber the Catholics.
Two other communions, the Protestant Episcopal and the
Unitarian, would be in the first rank of religious influence if
we attempted to measure and compare by this test. Taking
account of members only, the most difficult problem of religious
statistics is to determine whether any religious organization
is relatively increasing. The unattached population, and the
independent Protestant organizations, have been growing in
numbers for a score of years; and the Protestant communions
can not count by population without including the same persons
in more than one church. It is not surprising that the
Catholics most easily make an imposing array in the statistical
tables. The precise count is not important in this place. The
Catholics and Methodists are large bodies of American Christians,
and they have some common features as well as some
striking contrasts.</p>

<p>Both communions owe their success (if we take worldly
measurement) to their vigorous management and subordination
of their clergy for the good of the common cause. A
Methodist itinerant and a Catholic priest resemble each other
very little, but they are alike in being men who are “sent,”
and who “obey orders.” Their personal choices and well-being
are subordinated to a service and devotion. They alike
resign at the doors of the temple their rights to serve and
please themselves. It may be said that all Christians should
do this; but this self-surrender is to the priest and the itinerants
<i>objective</i> as well as <i>subjective</i>. It means that they go
where they are sent by a human authority which they identify
with the divine will. They are sacrificed to the general good;
they suffer that others may rejoice—always under an external
and visible authority. Another point of resemblance is the
<i>practical</i> liberty of laymen in both churches. Theoretically
the Catholic and the Methodist laymen are both bound to considerable
service and duties. Methodism began in a rigor of
religious duties which makes one wonder how John Wesley
missed founding a new Catholic order of world-renouncing
priests and lay brothers. Catholicism is theoretically even
more rigorous. In the progress of this century, both laities
have achieved more liberty than is good for them; the priest
and the itinerant serve and sacrifice for all. A bright-eyed
Methodist editor called attention some years ago to the fact
that his church tolerates no heresy in ministers and pays little
attention to the doctrinal vagaries of its laymen. It is doubtless
true of both Catholics and Methodists; though neither church
is prepared to make any admission of the sort or ever will be.
The theory in each case calls for sound believing; and it is
probably a just judgment which says that liberty is the atmosphere
required for the growth of sound faith.</p>

<p>Another point of resemblance between Catholic and Methodist
is that both communions have had a great mission to
preach to the poor; and that they have preached to such effect
that large numbers of their poor have become rich, not so
obviously in faith as in worldly goods. We mean not to sneer,
but to put our finger on the <i>objective</i> reality which lies before
us. He is a careless man who fails to see that Methodism and
Catholicism have produced industry, thrift, temperance and
wealth in classes of people who were miserably poor at the
outset. The fact has long been understood of Methodists; a
special fact has obscured this large one among Catholics.
There has been a steady inflow of poverty from the Old World
and the Catholics have received into their communion a very
large portion of this poverty. Their needy have been most
abundantly recruited and continue to be. But at the same
time their poor have grown wealthy all over the land. The
Puritan farmer is disappearing in New England and the Irish
Catholic is taking his place. Wealthy Catholics abound in all
the large cities.</p>

<p>There are many points of contrast between the two communions.
We suggest a single one, still looking at externals
and not at creeds. While Methodism has for a quarter of a
century been one of the most influential factors in politics—not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
at all as a machine, but altogether as an influence—Catholicism
has during the same period almost lapsed out of sight
as a political element. This resulted from the foreign character
and training of the majority of the priests and people, and
from wise avoidance of occasions of odium by the Catholic
prelates. We suggest this contrast without drawing any inferences
from it. For the near future, it is safe to predict a
change on the Catholic side. Their Baltimore council will, by
force of associations which are full of significance, tend to produce
change. In Baltimore the Catholic may properly remember
his claims to be and live an American of the Americans.
That church has had a vast body of foreigners to naturalize; it
has done the work under an array of obstacles which seemed too
formidable to be overcome. It is a near day when the Americanism
of the Catholics of this country will come to the proof
of its quality and value. At Baltimore the thoughtful priest
must have been moved to remember what claims he has on
the country and what claims the country has on him. We
shall as a people suffer some bitter trials and humiliations if
the Catholics are not to be genuine Americans and ardent patriots.
They are too many to be neutral or hostile.</p>

<h3>A POOR MAN’S MOTOR.</h3>

<p>The labor problem has not yet received a solution. Its
central difficulty is to secure to workmen a fair share of the
blessings of life. No one supposes that, taking the world together,
they do now receive a fair share. In this country,
workmen have fared uncommonly well; but there is a belief,
resting on some facts, that the actual rewards of labor, as
measured in the blessings of life, are rapidly declining, and
must go on declining under the existing industrial system.
Some theories on the subject are no longer tenable. The
workman’s theory that capital robs him is not sound. Money,
once worth ten per cent., has fallen to three per cent. for perfectly
safe loans; when higher interest is paid, it is paid for
conducting the business of lending (as in banks) or for risks
of the loans. The government can borrow a thousand and more
millions at two and one-half to three per cent.—and this shows
what a hard time of it capital is having. The risks of manufacturing
probably bleed labor; but the bleeding is not in the
form of which the workman thinks. It is not profit but loss
which drives the lancet in to the hilt. Political economists have
shown (and they are entirely unanimous) that the high profits
produce a competition which brings down profits. Capital is
cheap; large profits can be made only in conditions which are
monopolistic.</p>

<p>Our system of industrial exchange has one very weak place,
called <i>credit</i>. This credit is a hole in the net through which
industrial gains are dropped into the bottomless sea; and the
system is so fixed upon us that there is no hope of reform in
our day. To pay when we buy more and more offends something
in our make-up. A wise man proposed that one, two
and five dollar bills be abolished, in order that we might circulate,
as the French do, a large amount of silver. A member
of Congress immediately amended the suggestion thus: “No.
Put this silver in the United States Treasury, and let us use
‘silver notes.’” We insist upon having even a credit money,
and object to “the trouble” of handling coin. This refined and
transcendental sentiment, or taste, or æstheticism about coin
runs through us. The man who always pays, as well as the
sneak who never pays if he can avoid it, says, “Charge it,”
when he buys goods. Goods are sold by the manufacturer to
the jobber on credit; the jobber sells to the wholesale houses
on credit; the wholesale dealers sell to retailers on credit; the
retailers sell to consumers on credit. It is within the mark to
say, that more is lost in these four credit traps than capital
gets—much more. It is not, in fact, the capitalist, but the
well-dressed and the shabbily-dressed thieves who cheat and
rob labor.</p>

<p>At first sight, the reader will wonder how the losses of the
four credits come home to labor. We reply: they are
merely the aggregate of the risks incurred in making staple
goods—all other risks being insignificant in such manufacturing.
The order of things is like this: what the jobber loses
the manufacturer loses by the failure of the jobber. The jobber
loses what the dealers between him and the consumers
lose. Not quite all, perhaps, for the capitals of the dealers
must be of some worth; but the consumer has, in the end, to
pay all these losses, and the result is an enhanced price. In
other words, a bale of goods starts out with a burden of risk
which grows as it travels, and adds to the cost of goods so
much that the consumer can not buy as much as he needs. The
from 250 to 300 or more failures each week tell a part of the
workman’s trouble; another vast body of his losses does not
go to record at all. It is the fifty-cents-on-a-dollar compromise
system between wholesalers and retailers.</p>

<p>Workmen ought to get what consumers pay, less three per
cent. on capital and about as much more for risk of ordinary
kinds and a fair cost of handling goods. We maintain a
system of extraordinary risks, called a credit system, which
consumes two or three times as much as capital. It is plain
that workmen can not get (we write of such staples as cotton
cloth) pay for lost goods. Wherever they are lost, the sums lost
can not reach labor. We do not enter into the details of this
argument; we have suggested reasons for believing that a
cash system would stop one of the great leaks of the industrial
system.</p>

<p>There are other great wastes in the existing forms of industrial
management which, like the credit system, come out of
the bones and blood of the workman. We pass them by to
suggest that the industrial system has gone wrong, and can
never go right, under the empire of steam. Steam is a centralizer.
It concentrates industry, and by packing laborers into a
small compass <i>enhances the cost of living</i> and enlarges the
area of losses on sales and of distress in hard times. And to
go at once to our solution of the labor problem, we will describe
it as decentralization. A writer in <i>MacMillan’s Magazine</i> suggests
that electric motors may prove to be the decentralizing
force. Of course, it is not in the power of any material agent
to effect great changes except as it coöperates with our inclinations.
The expensiveness of steam machinery coöperated
with our inclination to congregate in cities. We have congregated
there. The larger half of our growth is in towns.
The result is dear food, dear rent, pestilential diseases, moral
degradation. When we grow sick of the experiment of building
a modern Babel, our inclinations may coöperate with a
motor energy which is plebeian and democratic. Let us suppose,
then, that a workman can make any of the innumerable
small articles which have iron or steel for a material. This
workman has his bits of machinery and tools in his house.
They do not cost more than a carpenter’s chest of tools. He
has the skill; he has the tools; he wants power. But a
neighbor tells him that he can buy in quart or gallon cans
stored-up electricity, and by a little contrivance, which may
cost fifty cents, he can attach his machinery to this democratic
motor and be an independent workman, with all the advantages
of machinery. He can make all these iron and steel contrivances
in the middle of a prairie and sell them to his neighbors
for cheap food and cheap rent. The <i>divisibility</i> of electric
power may make it the poor man’s friend. You can not
buy five cents’ worth of steam; there is now no reason to doubt
that electric power may be sold in five-cent packages if there
is a demand for it in such form. There is a vast aggregate of
small manufacturing. Of course there are great industries to
which our solution would not apply; but if half the laborers of
the country could work profitably, each man by himself, in
his own house—just as cobblers work—then the strain on
the large industries, such as iron and steel making, would be
so far reduced that workmen in those branches would probably
command, permanently, excellent wages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>This article aims to do nothing more than to open a window
of hope. We shall need to change a great deal; but the poor
man’s motor will probably help us to change. A good many
monopolies have grown up because steam favored their
growth; others are the fruits of general ignorance. Under the
sway of ignorance, the trade-mark becomes a tyrant, a grasping
monopolist. For example, there are no patents on sewing
machines, but machines of certain firms, wearing a certain
trade-mark, command a monopoly price. Any good mechanic
can build a good sewing machine for ten dollars. There might
be men in every town engaged in supplying the local wants
in the matter of sewing machines. No large factories, no
heavy transportation bills, no eloquent traveling agents would
be needed. There are thousands of things to which the same
rule will apply when there is a poor man’s motor and such a
diffusion of intelligence that the poor man can make, and
people will buy, the home-made articles. The empire of the
trade-mark will disappear when the motor and the intelligence
come along, and both seem to be coming. It will not be necessary—if
the motor arrives—to herd people together like cattle,
or to transport goods long distances. The workmen will carry
their kits of tools to the villages and live independently and
cheaply in the midst of their customers. Is this a dream?
But why should it not come true?</p>

<h3>REFORMED CRIMINALS.</h3>

<p>The French government is considering a proposition to restore
the custom of deporting criminals. It is remarkable that
the practical argument on this subject is decidedly favorable
to this system. The argument against it is a sentimental one.
The unsettled question about punishments for other than capital
offenses is, how to secure the reform of criminals. Under
the best managed prisons, reform of a lasting kind is rare.
The best management seems to succeed until the prisoner is
set at liberty. Then the reformed man finds himself an object
of suspicion to orderly people and of special interest and sympathy
to the criminal classes. The former will not employ him
and the latter will. The result is, in most cases, that he relapses
into crime. Perhaps there is some hope that the better
classes may improve in their habits; but unless they do, it is
well nigh useless to reform criminals in prison. The poor men
who come out into an unsympathetic world which does not believe
in their reformation, and in which unreformed ex-convicts
are numerous enough to keep the general distrust of their
class alive, have nothing like a fair chance to begin the world
over again. If there were any hope that prisons could be perfected
so as to reform all convicts, public prejudice could be
broken down; but it is too much to expect that the general
public will acquire a habit of distinguishing between good and
bad ex-convicts. This is the difficulty for which no device has
yet been found which will take it out of the path of humanitarian
prison discipline. No faith is more stable than that which,
among the public at large, affirms the total depravity of <i>some</i>
men; especially of ex-convicts.</p>

<p>Turning to penal colonies, experience is most favorable to
the belief that it opens the road to reform. The reports on the
British penal colonies are especially cheerful from this point
of view. The majority of the criminals sent abroad during three
centuries reformed their lives. Australia ought to be the most
disorderly country on the globe, if deporting criminals to a
colony could produce a bad society. But notwithstanding the
fact that England sent a large criminal population to that
colony, Australia is one of the most orderly and respectable of
the English dependencies. The only possible explanation is
that the official reports are true, and that the convicts did actually
reform. If Botany Bay did not reform them, the honest
opportunities of that vast island did coöperate with their good
purpose and promote their reform. England deported criminals
from 1597 to 1867—a period of 270 years. During the
War of Independence she suspended deportation and enrolled
her convicts in the armies sent to subjugate us. In 1838 more
than 100,000 criminals had been sent to Australia. An official
report sets forth that in 1850 an enumeration of ex-convicts in
Australia accounted for 48,600, and that all of them except an
insignificant fraction were living honestly. But it will be said
that Australia protested against the continuance of the system.
This is not the exact fact. In dealing with the question, the
English government threw upon the Australians all the expense
of the surveillance of the deported criminals. The colonial
government demanded, most righteously that England
should pay this bill of expense; but rather than pay it the English
Parliament chose to abolish the system of deportation. The
colonists did make sentimental objections to receiving convicts,
but they did so on the ground that the cost of watching
the criminals of England was unjustly thrown upon them. A
French writer remarks that in this case, as in the quarrel with
us, the money question was allowed to prevail over statesmanship.
The British ex-convict is worse off than our own because
there are fewer opportunities for men under the reproach
of prison service.</p>

<p>The French proposition to resort again to penal colonies, or
rather to dumping ship-loads of criminals on new and undeveloped
countries, suggests the seriousness of the question.
Every French colony will object to receiving the vicious cargoes
of humanity; but the objections will lose their violence
if the home government shall send a proper proportion of
French gold with each cargo. The testimony on the subject
seems to show that if the transported men are such as to give
signs of real reform, ninety-five per cent. of them will make
good citizens. The open country, the new moral scenery, the
necessities of that new world, conspire with good resolutions
to maintain reformed habits. What shall <i>we</i> do with our reformed
prisoners? It is not improbable that in a few years
England will imitate France and restore the system of deportation.
Why should not we make an experiment? Alaska, at
least, might safely be used for the purpose. It would not be
difficult to devise a system under which the best class of reformed
men should be offered land and a small outfit in some
remote corner of our country. By selecting the best, and making
their removal voluntary, we might save to society the
larger part of the men whom our prisons reform. We do not
wish to disguise the fact that, however remote the place, the
men who have lived by crime and escaped punishment would
endanger the virtue of the ex-convict. But the criminal classes
do not flow to the farthest frontiers except in scanty streams;
and the Alaskan territory is as yet as safe as a wilderness can
be. Some scheme of the sort is worth the devising. We are
making little headway under our present best systems, simply
because the ex-convict has no chance. Can he be given a
fair chance?</p>

<p>The Civil Service Reform League—and every reform is dependent
upon an organization—has addressed a letter to President-elect
Cleveland, asking him what he proposes to do
about removals from office. Mr. Cleveland answers, with full
information, that he believes in the doctrine of civil service
reform. We think that the practical application of the letter
to the civil service will make a real and safe basis for judgment.
Till we see this, we deem it wise not to express an opinion.</p>

<p>The old “Liberty bell,” which was on exhibition during the

Exposition in charge of a committee. The council of Philadelphia

<p>Our national Congress is the subject of a shameful scandal,
and the worst feature of it is, our Senators and Representatives
know it, but fail to correct it themselves. It is this: By figures
prepared by the Public Printer, it appears that during the last
four congresses nearly six hundred speeches have been published
in the “Congressional Record” as a part of the debates
and proceedings of Congress, but not one of them was ever
delivered in the House of Representatives. Here is a number
of printed but undelivered speeches of Senators. This
is an unnecessary expense entailed on the government. It is
a falsehood and makes the “Record” a lie, for you can not
tell by reading it what has been said or done in Congress.
Senator Vest has introduced a resolution into the Senate to
abolish the practice, but it is still an open question whether a
body of men who do such things will have the moral courage
to vote their undelivered speeches out of the “Record.”</p>

<p>A number of <i>Bradstreet’s</i>, issued in the latter part of December,
shows that at that time the whole number of men out
of employment in the United States, because the establishments

1880, which was 2,452,749.</p>

<p>Concerning General B. F. Butler, it is announced that he has
signed an agreement with a publishing house to write his political
reminiscences, in two volumes, for which he is to receive
$50,000 in cash and a royalty beside. The advent of Messrs.
Blaine and Butler into the literary world is suggestive. It is
altogether probable that both of these men regard literary
fame, when compared to political favor, as a more substantial
and enduring quantity, and believe that their names will live
longer in literature than in politics. Of course, there may be
other motives prompting them, but to some men <i>fame</i> hath its
peculiar charms.</p>

<p>It was a surprise and sorrow to Christian people to learn
that the management at New Orleans had decided to keep the
Exposition open on the Sabbath. The very liberal—perhaps we

Certainly to extend opportunities for making sight seeing and

The first premium for the best modern plow displayed

<p>There is no doubt of it—the cause of much human failure

<p>Now that Mark Twain is attempting to become his own publisher,
it may be of interest to read the record of his occupations.

<p>A winter resort where the thermometer falls frequently to
40° below zero, is fully launched at Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks.
The hotels are reported full, and prices of lots have

fashionable resorts by bringing into use many vigorous

<p>A reading people we know ourselves to be, but it is rather

<h3>COLLEGE GREEK COURSE IN ENGLISH.</h3>

<p>Articles on Plato may be found in the following works: Plato’s
“Republic,” De Quincey; “Plato,” Encyclopædia Britannica; Smith’s
“Greek and Roman Biography,” at the beginning of the various
editions of his works; Mahaffey’s “Classical Greek Literature;” Müller’s
“Literature of Ancient Greece;” “Against the Atheists,” <i>Christian
Examiner</i>, vol. xl, p. 108; “Life of Plato,” <i>Methodist Quarterly</i>,
vol. xx, p. 368; “On the Immortality of the Soul,” <i>Christian Repository</i>,
vol. xxii, p. 507; “Platonism,” <i>Baptist Quarterly</i>, vol. i, p. 22;
“Ethical Philosophy,” <i>American Church Repository</i>, vol. xxii, p. 175.</p>

<p>P. 86.—“Cicero,” etc. The “De Republica” was a dialogue on
what is the best form of the state; the “City of God” treats of the
body of Christians in distinction from the City of the World, or those
out of the church. St. Augustine wrote this book after the sack of
Rome by Alaric to answer the assertion that the destruction of the country
was a punishment for the desertion of the pagan deities; “Utopia”
is the story of an imaginary land supposed to have been discovered by
a companion of Amerigo Vespucci, where the laws were perfect; the
“New Atlantis” was an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,
where Bacon represents himself to have been shipwrecked, and where
he found societies for cultivating art and the sciences.</p>

<p>P. 96.—“Dæmon.” “This demon or genius of Socrates, which was
not personified by himself, was regarded by Plutarch as an intermediate
being between gods and men, by the fathers of the church as an evil
spirit, by Le Clerc as one of the fallen angels, by Ficino and Dacier as
a good angel, and by later writers as a personification of conscience or
practical instinct, or individual tact.”</p>

<p>P. 98.—“Origen.” (185?-254?) This eminent writer of the early
church fathers made an effort to reconcile Platonism with Christianity,
and in his commentaries on the Scriptures used the allegorical method
almost entirely. “The literal sense is always secondary; and the critic
never fails where it is possible to find in the simplest fact or the plainest
exhortation some hidden meaning.”</p>

<p>P. 99.—“Lemma.” When in demonstrating a proposition a second
proposition is introduced and assumed as true, or demonstrated for immediate
use, it is called a <i>lemma</i>.</p>

<p>P. 100.—“Oneida Community.” A society founded at Oneida, New
York State, by one John Humphrey Noyes, a perfectionist. He introduced
into this community his peculiar views, persuading them to practice
a community of women and of goods, to allow women equal business
and social privileges with the men, and to live in a “unitary home.”</p>

<p>P. 104.—“Silenus.” An attendant of Bacchus. He is represented
as a very ugly old man, fat, with a bald head and pug nose, and always
intoxicated. Generally he rode an ass or was carried by the
satyrs. Silenus was also represented as an inspired prophet. When
drunk and asleep he was in the power of mortals who could compel
him to sing and prophesy by surrounding him with chains of flowers.</p>

<p>P. 105.—“Marsyas.” See C. L. S. C. Notes, page 57 of <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> for October.</p>

<p>“Corybantian reveler.” So called from the Corybantes, the priests
of Cybele in Phrygia. They celebrated her worship in the wildest,
most frenzied dances. The drum and cymbal accompanied this dance.</p>

<p>P. 107.—“Brasidas.” The most famous of the Spartan leaders in
the Peloponnesian War. After taking many Athenian cities in Macedonia
he was killed at Amphipolis, where he defeated Cleon. He was
honored by the inhabitants as a hero.</p>

<p>“Nestor.” An aged Greek hero of the Trojan war, whose wisdom
and advice were considered equal to the gods. “Antenor” held a position
among the Trojans similar to that of Nestor among the Greeks.
His advice, however, was not followed by his countrymen, and he offered
to deliver the city to the Greeks. Upon the capture of Troy he
was spared by the victors.</p>

<p>P. 108.—“Boreas.” The North Wind was fabled to live in Thrace.
The allusion here is to the story that he carried away Orithyia, the
daughter of the king of Attica, for his wife.</p>

<p>“Agra;” the demus south
of Attica was called Agra. It contained two temples; one to Diana,
the other to Ceres.</p>

<p>“Typhon.” A monster born of Tartarus and Gæa, who attempted
to revenge the overthrow of the Titans. His head reached to heaven,
his eyes poured forth flame, and serpents were twined about his body.
Jupiter killed him with lightning.</p>

<p>P. 109.—“Agnus Castus,” or the “chaste tree,” the name given to a
plant native to the Mediterranean countries, which became associated
with the idea of chastity, it is said, from the similarity of the name
<i>agnus</i> to the Greek word <i>chaste</i>. Grecian matrons strewed their couches
with its leaves during the feast of Ceres, and in the convents of Southern
Europe a syrup made of its fruit was used by the nuns.</p>

<p>“Achelous.” A river god—a son of Oceanus—from the earliest
times worshiped generally throughout Greece. At one time he took
the form of a bull in a fight with Hercules, who conquered him and
took one of his horns. This horn the Naiads afterward changed into
the horn of plenty.</p>

<p>P. 118.—“Sunium.” The promontory forming the southern extremity
of Attica; a town of the same name stood upon it.</p>

<p>P. 121.—“Swan’s Utterance.” Referring to the fable told of the
swan, that it sings its sweetest song at death—“the sweetest song is the last
he sings.” Thus in “Othello,” “I will play the swan and die in music.”</p>

<p>P. 127.—The chapter on Æschylus may be supplemented by the following
readings: “Theory of Greek Tragedy,” De Quincey; Müller,
Mure, and Mahaffy on Æschylus, in their histories of Greek Literature;
Talfourd’s “Tragic Poets of Greece,” from “History of Greek Literature;”
Symond’s “Studies of the Greek Poets,” <i>Christian Examiner</i>,
Vol. xliii, p. 140; <i>Contemporary Magazine</i>, Vol. iii, p. 351; <i>Biblia
Sacra</i>, Vol. xvi, p. 354; <i>North American Review</i>, Vol. lxvii, p. 407.</p>

<p>P. 129.—“Cyprid.” A poem, author unknown, called Cyprid or
<i>Cypria</i>, “either because the author came from Cyprus, or because
it celebrated the Cyprian goddess, Aphrodite, and detailed from the
commencement her action in the Trojan war.… The poem
was an introduction to the ‘Iliad,’ telling a vast number of myths and
leading the reader from the first cause of the war up to the tenth year of
its duration. It is easy to see that such a vast subject, loosely connected,
must have failed to afford the artistic unity which underlies the course
of the ‘Iliad.’”</p>

<p>“Little Iliad.” A poem by Lesches, a Lesbian. It relates the
complete story of the sack of Troy, from the contest of Achilles
to the fall of Troy. The “Competition for the Arms,” we
have had in the “Iliad.” “Philoctetes” was the chief archer of
the Greeks, having been instructed by Hercules in the use of the bow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
On the voyage to Troy he was bitten by a snake and left on the
island of Lemnos. In the tenth year of the war the oracle declared
the city could not be taken without the arrows of Hercules. Philoctetes
was brought, and having slain Paris, the city was taken. “Neoptolemus,”
a son of Achilles, was one of the warriors that the
oracle declared necessary for the capture of Troy. He was one of
the heroes concealed in the wooden horse. “Eurypylus” who
came from Ormenion to Troy, played a prominent part in battle,
slaying many Trojans; he was wounded by Paris. “Ulysses Mendicant,”
the story of the wanderings of Ulysses. “Lacæna,” the Lacedæmonian
woman, referring to Helen. “Illii-persis,” treats of the plundering
of Troy after the capture, and “Apoplus,” of the sailing away
of the ships. “Sinon.” After the wooden horse was finished, Sinon
mutilated his body and allowed himself to be captured by the Trojans.
He told them that he had been maltreated by his countrymen, and that
if they (the Trojans) would drag the horse into the city they would
conquer the Greeks. After the Trojans had followed his advice he
let the Greeks out of the horse. “Troades,” the Trojans.</p>

<p>P. 134.—“Trilogy.” A set of three dramas. Each one is in itself
complete, but the three are related, one event following or growing
out of another, as in Shakspere’s Henry VI.</p>

<p>P. 13.—The abbreviations used in the atomic symbols are taken from
the Latin or Greek names, and when these differ from the English there
seems to be no correspondence between the name of the element and its
atomic symbol; as <i>Au</i> for gold.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is the lightest form of matter known, and the weight of its
atom is taken as the unit of the system of weights. In the table the
numbers in the column of atomic weights give the weight of one atom
of each substance as compared with one atom of hydrogen. For instance,
an atom of aluminum is twenty-seven times as heavy as an
atom of hydrogen.</p>

A French chemist. He suggested a new nomenclature which was
adopted by Lavoisier, and wrote a “Dictionary of Chemistry.”</p>

<p>P. 33.—The symbols are to be read by calling the letters and the small
numbers one after the other, in the order in which they occur. If a compound
contains an element which requires two letters to express it, the
latter one, always a small letter, as on page 35, AgNO₃, it is to be
read in the same way, with a shorter pause between the A and g than
between the other letters, as A-g—N—O-₃. Ag and O₃ might be compared
to words of two syllables. The number always belongs to the
letter which it follows.</p>

<h3>HOW ENGLISH DIFFERS FROM OTHER LANGUAGES.</h3>

<p id="english1"><a href="#anch_english1">1.</a> Perhaps this absurdity, and the complications it involves, may be
better illustrated by the following few lines from one of DeBertrand’s
novels. (They might be found in a dozen others.)</p>

<p>“Madame,” dit il, “il y a là une [feminine] personne qui demand M.
le Baron.”</p>

<p>“Quelle [feminine] est cette [feminine] personne?”</p>

<p>“C’est un [masculine] monsieur,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, both feminine and masculine articles must be used
to designate the same object; and a person must be spoken of as feminine,
although the person is a man; the reason being that <i>personne</i>, the
<i>word</i>, is feminine.—<i>Richard Grant White.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> “Madame,” said he, “there is a person without who asks for the Baron.”</p>

<p>“Who is this person?”</p>

<p>“It is a gentleman,” etc.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p id="english2"><a href="#anch_english2">2.</a> For contrary to apparently reasonable assumption, the history of
language shows that minute and highly wrought grammatical forms are
the signs, or at least the accompaniments, not of advanced civilization
and high culture, but of a rude and savage condition of society.
The further we penetrate the obscure of antiquity, the more grammar
we find. The oldest language known to us, the Sanskrit, is the most
complex and elaborate in its grammar; the youngest, English, is, to all
intents and purposes, grammarless; and Sanskrit grammar is at least
four thousand years old. My readers will now see why it was that I
said the minute forms and complicated grammatical relations of the
Greek language are not the signs of a high development of language,
but were relics of barbarism.—<i>Richard Grant White.</i></p>

<h3>SUNDAY READINGS.</h3>

<p id="sunday1"><a href="#anch_sunday1">1.</a> “Fuller,” Thomas. (1608-1661.) An English author and divine.
“The style of all his writings is extremely quaint and idiomatic, in
short, simple sentences, and singularly free from the pedantry of his
times.”—<i>American Cyclopædia.</i></p>

<p id="sunday2"><a href="#anch_sunday2">2.</a> “Robert Hall.” (1764-1831.) An English writer and preacher of
the Baptist church. When he was eleven years of age his teacher said
that he could not keep up with the boy. No man in modern times

<h3>CHEMISTRY.</h3>

<p id="chem1"><a href="#anch_chem1">1.</a> Transcriber’s Note: This note was omitted
in the original. Wikipedia has to say: “In general in ancient Greece, each state,
city or village possessed its own central hearth and sacred fire, representing
the unity and vitality of the community. The fire was kept alight continuously,
tended by the king or members of his family. The building in which this fire was
kept was the Prytaneum, and the chieftain (the king or prytanis) probably made
it his residence.”</p>

<p id="chem2"><a href="#anch_chem2">2.</a> “Lavoisier,” läˈvwäˈze-āˌ. See Appleton’s “Chemistry,” pages 19,
21 and 118. He was condemned to death by a revolutionary tribunal
at Paris on a frivolous charge brought against him as one of the farmers
of the taxes during the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p id="chem3"><a href="#anch_chem3">3.</a> “Phlogiston,” flo-jisˈton. Stahl supposed it to be pure fire, fixed
in combustible bodies in order to distinguish it from fire in a state of
liberty.</p>

<p id="chem4"><a href="#anch_chem4">4.</a> “Magnesium.” A shining, almost silver-white metal. When
heated it may be rolled out into very thin, long strips resembling ribbons,
which will burn with an intense light. In burning it produces
magnesium oxide or magnesia, which falls as a fine white powder.</p>

<p id="chem5"><a href="#anch_chem5">5.</a> “Dr. Priestly.” See “Chemistry,” page 118. (1733-1804.) An
eminent English divine and philosopher. His partiality to the French
Revolution excited the English against him, and in one of the riots his
home, library and manuscripts were destroyed by the fire kindled by an
angry mob. His later home was in Northumberland, Pa. He wrote
between seventy and eighty volumes on history, literature, theology and
science.</p>

<p id="chem6"><a href="#anch_chem6">6.</a> In a few volcanic districts steam escapes from the earth, which
contains small quantities of boric acid. These vapors are condensed
into water, which is again evaporated and the acid crystallized out.
When this acid is mixed with alcohol and the solution set on fire it
burns with a green flame. See “Chemistry,” page 157.</p>

<p id="chem7"><a href="#anch_chem7">7.</a> “Corpuscles of the blood.” Minute particles, both red and white,
existing in the blood, which can be seen under a microscope. In the
human species the red corpuscles are thick and circular. They are so
small that Young says it would take 255,000 of them to cover a surface
of a square inch. They are elastic and pliant, so that they can pass
through blood vessels having a smaller diameter than themselves. The
white corpuscles are more globular than the red, and contain more fat,
and have the power of changing their form. These spontaneous
changes have been thought by some scientists a proof that they are
microscopic animals. But this is scarcely a sufficient reason for admitting
that they are animalculæ, as the muscles of a body, when separated
from it, often manifest apparently spontaneous movements.</p>

<p id="chem8"><a href="#anch_chem8">8.</a> Phosphoric acid is always produced by burning phosphorus in air
or oxygen. The experiment may be performed as follows, but before
undertaking it see page 167 of the “Chemistry,” and note with how
much care it must be handled: Place a fragment of carefully dried
phosphorus in a small cup on a stand in the middle of a large plate,
ignite it by a hot wire, and place over it a bell-glass. White fumes will
fill the glass and aggregate into small particles, which will fall to the
plate, presenting the appearance of a miniature snow storm.</p>

<p id="chem9"><a href="#anch_chem9">9.</a> Barium is a yellow, lustrous, malleable metal. It is used in fireworks,
for the green color it gives off in burning.</p>

<p id="chem10"><a href="#anch_chem10">10.</a> “Bayberries.” The plant, called also wax myrtle, is a low, crooked
shrub found throughout the United States, especially near the sea coast.
It grows to a height of from three to eight feet. The naked flowers appear
in April and May, in clusters, of which from four to nine ripen
into dry berries. Plantations of them have long been cultivated in
Europe, and they have been raised in Algeria. For many years they
have been an article of commerce. A bushel of the berries will yield
from four to five pounds of wax.</p>

<p id="chem11"><a href="#anch_chem11">11.</a> “Strontium.” It takes its name from Strontian, in Scotland,
where it was first observed as a carbonate. It is a pale yellow metal,
harder than lead. If strontium carbonate be dissolved in nitric acid
and mixed with combustible substances it will burn with a beautiful
carmine red flame, and for this purpose is much used in fireworks.</p>

<p id="chem12"><a href="#anch_chem12">12.</a> “Sodium.” See “Chemistry,” page 67. It is a lustrous, silver-white,
soft metal. When thrown upon water, if it be prevented from
moving, or if the water be warm, it ignites, burning with its characteristic
yellow flame.</p>

<p id="chem13"><a href="#anch_chem13">13.</a> Extinguishing flame by carbon di-oxide. See “Chemistry,”
page 218.</p>

<p id="chem14"><a href="#anch_chem14">14.</a> “Lignite.” Also called brown coal. It is the most imperfectly
mineralized form of coal. In some instances plants are so little changed
that they can easily be classified by the structure of the leaves and the
fruit. The fiber has become so impregnated with bitumen that it burns
with its peculiar flame and smoke. The jet so much used in jewelry is a
black variety of lignite, very compact in texture, and taking a high polish.</p>

<p id="chem15"><a href="#anch_chem15">15.</a> “Kohinoor,” kohˌ-i-noorˈ (mountain of light). This famous
stone is now in possession of Queen Victoria. It was obtained before
the Christian era in one of the mines of Golconda, and passed to successive
sovereigns of India until it was borne away by a Persian conqueror
in the early part of the eighteenth century. In 1813 it was
bought back by the ruler of Punjaub. When Punjaub was annexed to
the East India Company’s territory it was surrendered to the Queen of
England. It is said to have weighed about 900 carats originally, but
by cutting to have been reduced to a weight of nearly 279 carats. By
recutting it was again reduced so as to weigh 186 carats, and at this
time was shown (1851) at the Great Exhibition. Since that time it has
been again recut, for the third time, and now weighs 123 carats, and
is estimated at $600,000. For the other “Paragons” see “Chemistry,”
page 204. It is questioned whether the “Grand Mogul” is a
pure diamond. The largest undoubted diamond is the “Orloff,” in the
scepter of the Emperor of Russia. It weighs 194¾ carats. The
“Regent” or “Pitt” is thought to be the purest and most perfect
brilliant in Europe. It weighs now 136¾ carats, but its original
weight was 410 carats, and the fragments split off when it was cut were
valued at some thousand pounds. It was placed in the hilt of the
sword of state by Napoleon I. The “Grand Duke” belongs to the Emperor
of Austria, and weighs 134 carats. The “Star of the South,”
found in Brazil, weighs 124 carats. The “Sancy” weighs only 53½
carats. It belongs to the Emperor of Russia.</p>

<p id="chem16"><a href="#anch_chem16">16.</a> “Golconda.” An ancient city and fortress of India, once the
metropolis of the kingdom of Golconda. It is renowned for its diamonds,
which are, in truth, only cut there.</p>

<p id="chem17"><a href="#anch_chem17">17.</a> “The Dark Continent.” Africa, so called because so little has
been known of it through all history; but through the zeal and enterprise
of modern explorers we are led to hope that “the day is not far
distant when the secret places of this land of mystery will be penetrated
by the light of science and civilization.”</p>

cardinal, the author of several works. He is the son of the late William
Manning, member of Parliament, and governor of the Bank of
England. He was educated at Oxford, as a member of the Church of
England. In 1857 he joined the Catholics, and was ordained priest.
In 1865 he was nominated by the pope Archbishop of Westminster, and
in 1875 he was made cardinal, an office next in rank to that of pope.
He is one of the most prominent men in London, and the leading representative
of the Roman Catholic Church in England.</p>

<p id="science4"><a href="#anch_science4">4.</a> “Thugs.” A set of robbers and assassins who lived in India, and

Lord Aberdeen as prime minister in 1855, and retired in 1858,
on account of the defeat of a bill introduced with reference to the attempted
murder of Napoleon III. by Orsini. In 1859 he was again
made premier and held the post until his death.</p>

<p id="science7"><a href="#anch_science7">7.</a> “Loch Fyne.” An inlet of the sea on the western coast of Scotland,
running into Argyle for about forty miles, with an average width
of five miles. The town of Inverary stands near its head.</p>

<p id="science8"><a href="#anch_science8">8.</a> “Homberg.” A town in Prussia, noted for the gambling which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was extensively carried on there formerly, but which was suppressed by
the Prussian government in 1870.</p>

<p>“Baden,” or “Baden-Baden.” A German watering place situated
on the Oos, at the foot of the Black Forest. It was formerly celebrated
for the gaming tables found in the <i>Conversationshaus</i>, which was the
principal resort for visitors. The licenses for gambling expired in 1872,
and have not since been renewed. Those who have read “Daniel Deronda”
will remember that it was at Baden that Deronda first saw
Gwendolen Harleth, when she was engaged in gambling. The description
of the persons gathered round the long tables is very interesting
and vivid, and gives a good insight into fashionable life at Baden in
those days.</p>

<p id="science9"><a href="#anch_science9">9.</a> “Lord Brougham.” (1779-1868.) Lord Chancellor of England.
He took a strong stand on the side of the suppression of the slave trade,

plaster of Paris.</p>

<p id="kitchen10"><a href="#anch_kitchen10">10.</a> “Caper.” The caper bush is a native of the south of Europe;
it is a climbing shrub which flowers all summer. The buds are gathered
every morning, and preserved in vinegar and salt. They have an

<h3>HOUSEHOLD BEVERAGES.</h3>

<p id="bev1"><a href="#anch_bev1">1.</a> “Made-over tea.” In Chinese tea houses, large jars are kept, into
which the dregs of all the tea that has been used are thrown. These
exhausted leaves are dried, carefully rolled again, and thrown upon the
market for a second sale. It is said this tea is easily detected if
coloring matter has been used, but when re-rolled without, only a chemical
analysis can disclose the fraud.</p>

<p id="bev2"><a href="#anch_bev2">2.</a> “Reliable.” Much fault has been found by critics with this word.
It is claimed that it has no right to a place in our language. <i>Able</i> or
<i>ible</i> is a suffix which, added to the stem of a transitive verb, gives an
adjective which may be defined by placing the word <i>able</i> before the passive
infinitive of the verb whose stem has been used; for example:
tolerable, able to be tolerated; admissable, able to be admitted; deniable,
able to be denied, etc. But reliable means able to be relied <i>upon</i>.
The preposition has to be supplied. The proper form of the adjective
would be the awkward word, “relionable,” or “reliuponable.” The
word is favored in the dictionaries, but trustworthy is preferable.</p>

<p id="bev3"><a href="#anch_bev3">3.</a> “Cosey.” A wadded cap made to fit the tea-pot closely, and thus

<h3>THE CIRCLE OF THE SCIENCES.</h3>

<p id="circle1"><a href="#anch_circle1">1.</a> “Napier,” naˈpe-er, John. (1550-1617.) An English mathematician.
“Logarithms” are numbers so related to natural numbers that
the multiplication and division of the latter may be performed by addition
and subtraction, and the raising to powers and the extraction of
roots by the multiplication and division of the former. They are arranged
in tables which can be readily understood and used, and they
save enormous calculations and labor.</p>

<p id="circle2"><a href="#anch_circle2">2.</a> “Kepler,” Johann. A German astronomer.</p>

<p id="circle3"><a href="#anch_circle3">3.</a> “Mercator’s Chart.” In all the charts in use before Mercator’s,
curved lines were drawn representing the meridians and parallels. A
vessel which followed these lines always receded too far from the equator,
and, if land did not intervene, would describe a spiral course and
finally reach the pole. Mercator constructed a map as follows: A line,
AB, was drawn representing the equator, and was divided into 36, 24
or 18 equal parts for meridians at 10°, 15°, or 20° apart, and the meridians
were then drawn through them perpendicular to AB. The distance of
the parallels and the tropics, and the arctic circles were marked from the
equator on the sides, and these points joined by straight lines. The map
does not give a natural representation, as the polar regions are immensely
exaggerated. The distortions in the form of the countries and the relative
distances of places are rectified by making the degrees of latitude
increase proportionably to those of longitude.</p>

<p id="circle4"><a href="#anch_circle4">4.</a> “Quadrant.” Quadrants were used for surveying, making astronomical
observations, and, in navigation, for determining the meridian
altitude of the sun, and from that the latitude of the observer. They
were made of a great variety of form and size to suit their several uses.
The interest attaching to them at the present time is chiefly historical,
as they have been superseded by the sextant and the full circle.</p>

<p>That most remarkable poem of the Orient, the “Rubáiyát”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> of Omar
Khayyám, has recently had the rare fortune of receiving from translator,
artist and publisher an almost perfect treatment. Its translation
places it among English classic poems, its illustration and make-up
among American classic art books. This poem, very imperfectly known
among us, is the work of a Persian astronomer and poet, Omar Khayyám,
or Omar the Tent-Maker, a native of Naishapúr, in Khorassan.
He was born in the latter half of the eleventh century, and became a
favorite of the rulers of the realm. His life was, so goes the chronicle,
“busied in winning knowledge of every kind, and especially in astronomy,
wherein he attained to a very high preēminence. Under the Sultanate
of Malik Shah, he came to Merv and obtained great praise for
his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered favors upon him.”
Omar was an honest thinker; he refused the hollow mysticism of the
times, and framed a system which approaches Epicureanism. His views
of life, his fruitless search for Providence, his sad conclusion,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I came like water, and like wind I go,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">together with his final refuge in the wine cup, with the command</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Drink, for you know not whence you came nor why,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Drink, for you know not why you go, nor where,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">are the subjects of his “Rubáiyát,” or quatrains. In the original these
verses have no connection. The translator, Mr. Edward Fitzgerald,
selected those which seemed to him most suitable, and arranged them
into a sort of eclogue. This translation met with a hearty reception.
Mr. Fitzgerald had been fortunate enough to make Omar Khayyám much
more lucid and entertaining than Omar had made himself. An interpretation
of the poem was undertaken in May 1883, by Elihu Vedder.
The interest in the elegant volume just issued by Messrs. Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co., centers, of course, about these illustrations. There is not
a line of the poem but what takes a new and powerful meaning under
his treatment. Indeed, it seems as if in many cases the verses were but
a key-note, the drawing the completed strain. The artist seems to have
been inspired by the same sense of mystery, sadness, and final devotion
to pleasure which influenced the author. His idea of Omar’s philosophy
is most beautifully represented in the picture called “Omar’s Emblem.”
In it life is represented by a whirling stream, upon which the
mortal, under the form of a rose, has floated in. Along the stream the
leaves are scattered here and there, while crushed and half petalless
the rose floats into oblivion. This whirl of life surrounds what we
may suppose to be the emblem which incessantly confronted Omar’s
mind—a human skull; upon this is perched a singing nightingale—a
sign of the music which in spite of the mockery of existence the poet
always heard, and in which he found the sole relief for living. The pictures
include a wealth of suggestion which only diligent and sympathetic
study discloses. They show surprising fancy and versatility, while at
the same time the finish of each is most perfect.</p>

<p>Among the handsome books of the year must be classed Cassell’s
new edition of “Atala,”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> Chauteaubriand’s charming romance of Indian
life and love. Though the story is far from filling our modern ideas of
a novel, it is one of those rare, pure love tales which never loses its
hold upon us. It will always keep its place with “Undine” and “Paul
and Virginia.” The present edition contains illustrations by Gustave
Doré, which, though inferior in some respects to later works by
him, are still very beautiful pictures. Only a few of the illustrations of
the “Atala” show that weird power and strong imagination for which
Doré is so famous, but what we miss there is quite made up by the interest
we feel in his conceptions of American scenery, of which he knew
nothing except from description. These conceptions, if sometimes very
incorrect, are still full of exuberant fancy. The binding and letter-press
of the volume are superior, making a most charming gift book.</p>

<p>The “Prose Writings of William Cullen Bryant,”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> edited by Parke
Godwin will meet with a cordial welcome from all readers of good literature.
They appear in two volumes, and properly belong to a set
called “The Life and Works of William Cullen Bryant,” forming the
fifth and sixth volumes of the set. It was the thought of the editor at
first to publish entire the orations, addresses, and various letters of Mr.
Bryant, but careful consideration led him to think that this would extend
the work beyond desirable limits; so it was confined to a few selections
from the various departments in which the author displayed his
power. Volume V of the set, or I of the “Prose Writings,” contains
several “Literary Essays,” “Narratives,” and “Commemorative Discourses”
on Cooper, Irving, Halleck, and Verplanck. Volume II contains
“Sketches of Travel,” “Occasional Addresses,” comprising those
on Shakspere, Scott, Burns, Goethe, Schiller, and many others; and
“Editorial Comments and Criticisms.” The selections are all timely and
well adapted to catch the reader’s fancy and interest. There can scarcely
fail to come to one, however, who is the possessor of these books, a feeling
of regret that the editor did not follow his original intention and
give more of the writings of the author. The wish to have at hand the
complete works of the great American, and to have them in as attractive
a form as that in which Mr. Godwin has arranged them is strong
enough to far outweigh his unjustifiable fear of making too voluminous
a collection.</p>

<p>Among the many beautiful things which art and taste and
money combined to furnish for the holidays nothing surpassed
the Christmas cards of L. Prang &amp; Co. In design, coloring
and finish it is difficult to see how they could be improved. It
will interest those of our readers who expect to visit the New
Orleans Exposition to know that all Messrs. Prang &amp; Co.’s
former prize cards and the frames, with consecutive proofs of
a reproduction, have been sent to the Massachusetts department
at New Orleans by special invitation of the State Commission.
The collection of prize designs recently exhibited in
New York and Boston by Mr. L. Prang is now, by special invitation,
shown in the Art Institute in Chicago, and, in response
to a similar request made by the managers of the
Museum of Fine Arts at St. Louis, this collection of paintings
will be sent to that city later on.</p>

<p>People of all denominations loved and honored Bishops
Simpson and Asbury of the M. E. Church. At the recent centennial
celebration of that church a fitting souvenir to these
two noble men was displayed in the form of medallions, on

medallions were mounted in a leather case lined with satin.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
